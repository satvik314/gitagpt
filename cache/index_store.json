When determining variance in thickness, exclude the outside edges of a mailpiece (1 inch from each edge) when the contents do not extend into those edges. Also, exclude the selvage of any polywrap covering (see 201.5.3) from this determination. Mailers must secure nonpaper contents to prevent shifting of more than 2 inches within the mailpiece if shifting would cause the piece to be nonuniform in thickness or would result in the contents bursting out of the mailpiece (see 601.3.3). 2.5Ineligible Flat-Size Pieces Flat-size mailpieces that do not meet the eligibility standards in 2.3 and 2.4 are considered parcels, and customers mailing these pieces must pay the applicable parcel prices. 3.0Physical Standards for Parcels 3.1Processing Categories USPS categorizes parcels into one of three mail processing categories: machinable, irregular, or nonmachinable parcel.

Why it should be so appealing to the Western mind is an interesting question. It has drama, for its setting is a scene of two great armies, banners flying, drawn up opposite one another on the field, poised for battle. It has ambiguity, and the fact that Arjuna and his charioteer Kåñëa are carrying on their dialogue between the two armies suggests the indecision of Arjuna about the basic question: should he enter battle against and kill those who are friends and kinsmen? It has mystery, as Kåñëa demonstrates to Arjuna His cosmic form. It has a properly complicated view of the ways of the religious life and treats of the paths of knowledge, works, discipline and faith and their","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"2d867c09-f74c-4830-ab77-b967b329f9fb":{"id_":"2d867c09-f74c-4830-ab77-b967b329f9fb","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8bf3dc66-38f1-4f54-8397-18ac742fefb6","metadata":{},"hash":"/72GhfcjR4dpWqGfCx1Xh1297ibhQV6vJOSUjDbNfZw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e4eafc84-6856-4f68-8aae-5187e6652eed","metadata":{},"hash":"5X696iIJ+1WTQCx7/tD5jVVWB/dntFUNFTb6J3vqmvQ="}},"hash":"nbwNmnL0Sj76MbBK1L4x70P9ojyuhR/mh1CuQ24MaUw=","text":"and treats of the paths of knowledge, works, discipline and faith and their inter-relationships, problems that have bothered adherents of other religions in other times and places. The devotion spoken of is a deliberate means of religious satisfaction, not a mere outpouring of poetic emotion. Next to the Bhägavata-puräëa, a long work from South India, the Gétä is the text most frequently quoted in the philosophical writings of the Gauòéya Vaiñëava school, the school represented by Swami Bhaktivedanta as the latest in a long succession of teachers. It can be said that this school of Vaiñëavism was founded, or revived, by Çré Kåñëa-Caitanya Mahäprabhu (1486-1533) in Bengal, and that it is currently the strongest single religious force in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent. The Gauòiya Vaiñëava school, for whom Kåñëa is Himself the Supreme God, and not merely an incarnation of another deity, sees bhakti as an immediate and powerful religious force, consisting of love between man and God. Its discipline consists of devoting all one’s actions to the Deity, and one listens to the stories of Kåñëa from the sacred texts, one chants Kåñëa’s name, washes, bathes, and dresses the mürti of Kåñëa, feeds Him and takes the remains of the food offered to Him, thus absorbing His grace; one does these things and many more, until one has been changed: the devotee has become transformed into one close to Kåñëa, and sees the Lord face to face. Swami Bhaktivedanta comments upon the Gétä from this point of view, and that is legitimate. More than that, in this translation the Western reader has the unique opportunity of seeing how a Kåñëa devotee interprets his own texts. It is the Vedic exegetical tradition, justly famous, in action. This book is then a welcome addition from many points of view. It can serve as a valuable textbook for the college student.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e4eafc84-6856-4f68-8aae-5187e6652eed":{"id_":"e4eafc84-6856-4f68-8aae-5187e6652eed","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2d867c09-f74c-4830-ab77-b967b329f9fb","metadata":{},"hash":"nbwNmnL0Sj76MbBK1L4x70P9ojyuhR/mh1CuQ24MaUw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0f967436-5fdf-49cf-9632-f9b8c46d6f3b","metadata":{},"hash":"d3Ly1YzPlwN2etOvSzFSbciOZ7wvaTnK70cg+6Qjxr4="}},"hash":"5X696iIJ+1WTQCx7/tD5jVVWB/dntFUNFTb6J3vqmvQ=","text":"It can serve as a valuable textbook for the college student. It allows us to listen to a skilled interpreter explicating a text which has profound religious meaning. It gives us insights into the original and highly convincing ideas of the Gauòiya Vaiñëava school. In providing the Sanskrit in both Devanagari and transliteration, it offers the Sanskrit specialist the opportunity to re-interpret, or debate particular Sanskrit meanings―although I think there will be little disagreement about the quality of the Swami’s Sanskrit scholarship. And finally, for the nonspecialist, there is readable English and a devotional attitude which cannot help but move the sensitive reader. And there are the paintings, which, incredibly as it may seem to those familiar with contemporary Indian religious art, were done by American devotees. The scholar, the student of Gauòéya Vaiñëavism, and the increasing number of Western readers interested in classical Vedic thought have been done a service by Swami Bhaktivedanta. By bringing us a new and living interpretation of a text already known to many, he has increased our understanding manyfold; and arguments for understanding, in these days of estrangement, need not be made. Professor Edward C. Dimock, Jr. Department of South Asian Languages and Civilization University of Chicago Preface Originally I wrote Bhagavad-gétä As It Is in the form in which it is presented now. When this book was first published, the original manuscript was, unfortunately, cut short to less than 400 pages, without illustrations and without explanations for most of the original verses of the Çrémad Bhagavad- gétä. In all of my other books—Çrémad Bhägavatam, Çré Éçopaniñad, etc.—the system is that I give the original verse, its English transliteration, word-for- word Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations and purports. This makes the book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning self-evident. I was not very happy, therefore, when I had to minimize my original manuscript.

Macmillan and Co. agreed to publish the complete edition. Thus the present attempt is to offer the original manuscript of this great book of knowledge with full paramparä explanation in order to establish the Kåñëa consciousness movement more soundly and progressively. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is genuine, historically authorized, natural and transcendental due to its being based on Bhagavad-gétä As It Is. It is gradually becoming the most popular movement in the entire world, especially amongst the younger generation. It is becoming more and more interesting to the older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming interested, so much so that the fathers and grandfathers of my disciples are encouraging us by becoming life members of our great society, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many fathers and mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of gratitude for my leading the Kåñëa consciousness movement throughout the entire world. Some of them said that it is greatly fortunate for the Americans that I have started the Kåñëa consciousness movement in America. But actually the original father of this movement is Lord Kåñëa Himself, since it was started a very long time ago but is coming down to human society by disciplic succession. If I have any credit in this connection, it does not belong to me personally, but it is due to my eternal spiritual master, His Divine Grace Om Viñëupäda Paramahaàsa Parivräjakäcärya 108 Çré Çrémad Bhaktisiddhänta Sarasvaté Gosvämé Mahäräja Prabhupäda. If personally I have any credit in this matter, it is only that I have tried to present Bhagavad-gétä as it is, without adulteration.

But our attempt, in presenting Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, is to present the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Our business is to present the will of Kåñëa, not that of any mundane speculator like the politician, philosopher or scientist, for they have very little knowledge of Kåñëa, despite all their other knowledge. When Kåñëa says, man-manä bhava mad-bhakto mad-yäjé mäà namaskuru, etc., we, unlike the so-called scholars, do not say that Kåñëa and His inner spirit are different. Kåñëa is absolute, and there is no difference between Kåñëa’s name, Kåñëa’s form, Kåñëa’s quality, Kåñëa’s pastimes, etc. This absolute position of Kåñëa is difflcult to understand for any person who is not a devotee of Kåñëa in the paramparä (disciplic succession) system. Generally the so-called scholars, politicians, philosophers, and svämés, without perfect knowledge of Kåñëa, try to banish or kill Kåñëa when writing commentary on Bhagavad-gétä. Such unauthorized commentary upon Bhagavad-gétä is known as Mäyävädé-Bhäñya, and Lord Caitanya has warned us about these unauthorized men. Lord Caitanya clearly says that anyone who tries to understand Bhagavad-gétä from the Mäyävädé point of view will commit a great blunder. The result of such a blunder will be that the misguided student of Bhagavad-gétä will certainly be bewildered on the path of spiritual guidance and will not be able to go back home, back to Godhead. Our only purpose is to present this Bhagavad-gétä As It Is in order to guide the conditioned student to the same purpose for which Kåñëa descends to this planet once in a day of Brahmä, or every 8,600,000,000 years.

Lord Kåñëa first spoke Bhagavad-gétä to the sun-god some hundreds of millions of years ago. We have to accept this fact and thus understand the historical significance of Bhagavad-gétä, without misinterpretation, on the authority of Kåñëa. To interpret Bhagavad-gétä without any reference to the will of Kåñëa is the greatest offense. In order to save oneself from this offense, one has to understand the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He was directly understood by Arjuna, Lord Kåñëa’s first disciple. Such understanding of Bhagavad-gétä is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human society in fulfilling the mission of life. The Kåñëa consciousness movement is essential in human society, for it offers the highest perfection of life. How this is so is explained fully in the Bhagavad- gétä. Unfortunately, mundane wranglers have taken advantage of Bhagavad- gétä to push forward their demonic propensities and mislead people regarding right understanding of the simple principles of life. Everyone should know how God or Kåñëa is great, and everyone should know the factual position of the living entities. Everyone should know that a living entity is eternally a servant and that unless one serves Kåñëa one has to serve illusion in different varieties of the three modes of material nature, and thus perpetually one has to wander within the cycle of birth and death; even the so-called liberated Mäyävädé speculator has to undergo this process. This knowledge constitutes a great science, and each and every living being has to hear it for his own interest.

A living entity is happily the part and parcel of the Lord, and thus his natural function is to render immediate service to the Lord. By the spell of illusion one tries to be happy by serving his personal sense gratification in different forms which will never make him happy. Instead of satisfying his own personal material senses, he has to satisfy the senses of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life. The Lord wants this, and He demands it. One has to understand this central point of Bhagavad-gétä. Our Kåñëa consciousness movement is teaching the whole world this central point, and because we are not polluting the theme of Bhagavad-gétä As It Is, anyone seriously interested in deriving benefit by studying the Bhagavad-gétä must take help from the Kåñëa consciousness movement for practical understanding of Bhagavad-gétä under the direct guidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, that people will derive the greatest benefit by studying Bhagavad-gétä As It Is as we have presented it here, and if even one man becomes a pure devotee of the Lord we shall consider our attempt a success.

Of course there are many commentaries in English on the Bhagavad-gétä, and one may question the necessity for another one. This present edition can be explained in the following way. Recently an American lady asked me to recommend an English translation of Bhagavad-gétä. Of course in America there are so many editions of Bhagavad-gétä available in English, but as far as I have seen, not only in America but also in India, none of them can be strictly said to be authoritative because in almost every one of them the commentator has expressed his own opinions without touching the spirit of Bhagavad-gétä as it is.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"195611b4-9723-428c-9151-e72973a70719":{"id_":"195611b4-9723-428c-9151-e72973a70719","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"383a577d-0050-43a6-86e0-1b09930bb379","metadata":{},"hash":"DCIkOuXfF+RzV/SVPyK8NljiMgyCw4Z3N7RApR2lKNI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1263c9d8-fa4b-4a23-8599-e2548247ea05","metadata":{},"hash":"HXt+JWPkwaj/28K52181Aeb8UvtmhxJgtbZLY8owVW0="}},"hash":"GEFoaJyjpKU1Ex6b7ObxUlj28qDbfXyM3p4LOOoqhKM=","text":"it is.

We cannot take the medicine according to our own whim or the direction of a friend. It must be taken according to the directions on the label or the directions given by a physician. Similarly, Bhagavad-gétä should be taken or accepted as it is directed by the speaker himself. The speaker of Bhagavad-gétä is Lord Çré Kåñëa. He is mentioned on every page of Bhagavad-gétä as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavän. Of course the word “bhagavän” sometimes refers to any powerful person or any powerful demigod, and certainly here Bhagavän designates Lord Çré Kåñëa as a great personality, but at the same time we should know that Lord Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as is confirmed by all great äcäryas (spiritual masters) like Çaìkaräcärya, Rämänujäcärya, Madhväcärya, Nimbärka Svämé, Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu and many other authorities of Vedic knowledge in India.

But in the course of time it has become lost. Consequently the Lord has to speak it again, this time to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. He tells Arjuna that He is relating this supreme secret to him because he is His devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-gétä is a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There are three classes of transcendentalists, namely the jïäné, the yogé and the bhakta, or the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the Lord clearly tells Arjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new paramparä (disciplic succession) because the old succession was broken. It was the Lord’s wish, therefore, to establish another paramparä in the same line of thought that was coming down from the sun-god to others, and it was His wish that His teaching be distributed anew by Arjuna. He wanted Arjuna to become the authority in understanding the Bhagavad-gétä.

That is to say he must be a devotee in a direct relationship with the Lord. As soon as one becomes a devotee of the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord. That is a very elaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a devotee is in a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of five different ways: 1. One may be a devotee in a passive state; 2. One may be a devotee in an active state; 3. One may be a devotee as a friend; 4. One may be a devotee as a parent; 5. One may be a devotee as a conjugal lover. Arjuna was in a relationship with the Lord as friend. Of course there is a gulf of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in the material world. This is transcendental friendship which cannot be had by everyone. Of course everyone has a particular relationship with the Lord, and that relationship is evoked by the perfection of devotional service. But in the present status of our life, we have not only forgotten the Supreme Lord, but we have forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord. Every living being, out of many, many billions and trillions of living beings, has a particular relationship with the Lord eternally. That is called svarüpa. By the process of devotional service, one can revive that svarüpa, and that stage is called svarüpa-siddhi—perfection of one’s constitutional position. So Arjuna was a devotee, and he was in touch with the Supreme Lord in friendship. How Arjuna accepted this Bhagavad-gétä should be noted. His manner of acceptance is given in the Tenth Chapter.

After hearing Bhagavad-gétä from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna accepted Kåñëa as Paraà Brahma, the Supreme Brahman. Every living being is Brahman, but the supreme living being, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the Supreme Brahman. Paraà dhäma means that He is the supreme rest or abode of everything, pavitram means that He is pure, untainted by material contamination, puruñam means that He is the supreme enjoyer, divyam, transcendental, ädi-devam, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ajam, the unborn, and vibhum, the greatest, the all-pervading.

Sarvam etad åtaà manye: “I accept everything You say to be true.” Arjuna also says that the personality of the Lord is very difficult to understand and that He cannot be known even by the great demigods. This means that the Lord cannot even be known by personalities greater than human beings. So how can a human being understand Çré Kåñëa without becoming His devotee? Therefore Bhagavad-gétä should be taken up in a spirit of devotion. One should not think that he is equal to Kåñëa, nor should he think that Kåñëa is an ordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord Çré Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at least theoretically, according to the statements of Bhagavad-gétä or the statements of Arjuna, the person who is trying to understand the Bhagavad-gétä. We should therefore at least theoretically accept Çré Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and with that submissive spirit we can understand the Bhagavad-gétä. Unless one reads the Bhagavad-gétä in a submissive spirit, it is very difficult to understand Bhagavad-gétä because it is a great mystery. Just what is the Bhagavad-gétä? The purpose of Bhagavad-gétä is to deliver mankind from the nescience of material existence. Every man is in difficulty in so many ways, as Arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight the Battle of Kurukñetra. Arjuna surrendered unto Çré Kåñëa, and consequently this Bhagavad-gétä was spoken. Not only Arjuna, but every one of us is full of anxieties because of this material existence.

Out of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are actually inquiring about their position, as to what they are, why they are put into this awkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened to this position of questioning his suffering, unless he realizes that he doesn’t want suffering but rather wants to make a solution to all sufferings, then one is not to be considered a perfect human being. Humanity begins when this sort of inquiry is awakened in one’s mind. In the Brahma-sütra this inquiry is called “brahma- jijïäsä.” Every activity of the human being is to be considered a failure unless he inquires about the nature of the Absolute. Therefore those who begin to question why they are suffering or where they came from and where they shall go after death are proper students for understanding Bhagavad-gétä. The sincere student should also have a firm respect for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a student was Arjuna. Lord Kåñëa descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose of life when man forgets that purpose. Even then, out of many, many human beings who awaken, there may be one who actually enters the spirit of understanding his position, and for him this Bhagavad-gétä is spoken. Actually we are all followed by the tiger of nescience, but the Lord is very merciful upon living entities, especially human beings. To this end He spoke the Bhagavad-gétä, making His friend Arjuna His student. Being an associate of Lord Kåñëa, Arjuna was above all ignorance, but Arjuna was put into ignorance on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra just to question Lord Kåñëa about the problems of life so that the Lord could explain them for the benefit of future generations of human beings and chalk out the plan of life.

There is éçvara, which means controller, and there are jévas, the living entities which are controlled. If a living entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he is insane. The living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his conditioned life. So in the Bhagavad-gétä the subject matter deals with the éçvara, the supreme controller, and the jévas, the controlled living entities. Prakåti (material nature) and time (the duration of existence of the whole universe or the manifestation of material nature) and karma (activity) are also discussed. The cosmic manifestation is full of different activities. All living entities are engaged in different activities. From Bhagavad-gétä we must learn what God is, what the living entities are, what prakrti is, what the cosmic manifestation is and how it is controlled by time, and what the activities of the living entities are. Out of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-gétä it is established that the Supreme Godhead, or Kåñëa, or Brahman, or supreme controller, or Paramätmä―you may use whatever name you like―is the greatest of all. The living beings are in quality like the supreme controller. For instance, the Lord has control over the universal affairs, over material nature, etc., as will be explained in the later chapters of Bhagavad-gétä. Material nature is not independant. She is acting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. As Lord Kåñëa says, “Prakåti is working under My direction.” When we see wonderful things happening in the cosmic nature, we should know that behind this cosmic manifestation there is a controller. Nothing could be manifested without being controlled. It is childish not to consider the controller.

A particle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is also salty, and similarly, we the living entities, being part and parcel of the supreme controller, ésvara, or Bhagavän, Lord Çré Kåñëa, have all the qualities of the Supreme Lord in minute quantity because we are minute éçvaras, subordinate éçvaras. We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying to control space or planets, and this tendency to control is there because it is in Kåñëa. But although we have a tendency to lord it over material nature, we should know that we are not the supreme controller. This is explained in Bhagavad-gétä. What is material nature? This is also explained in Gétä as inferior prakåti, inferior nature. The living entity is explained as the superior prakåti. Prakåti is always under control, whether inferior or superior. Prakåti is female, and she is controlled by the Lord just as the activities of a wife are controlled by the husband. Prakåti is always subordinate, predominated by the Lord, who is the predominator. The living entities and material nature are both predominated, controlled by the Supreme Lord. According to the Gétä, the living entities, although parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered prakåti. This is clearly mentioned in the Seventh Chapter, fifth verse of Bhagavad- gétä: “Apareyam itas tv anyäm.” “This prakåti is My lower nature.” “Prakåtià viddhi me paräm jéva-bhütäà mahä-bäho yayedaà dhäryate jagat.” And beyond this there is another prakåti: jéva-bhütäm, the living entity.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"628cb66b-24de-4aa6-93cc-6a23b5d90fe8":{"id_":"628cb66b-24de-4aa6-93cc-6a23b5d90fe8","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"993d3997-6a58-47d4-aaa8-c834037b539e","metadata":{},"hash":"yD9bxuMjxUwDQMdNQs7bCsBJyR/whfg1ZJfWse8Q6zA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"57497640-72b6-41a4-926d-27bbef7f8541","metadata":{},"hash":"6f3piRjON7djDy8FE4fyHxJ90hLWlx8zegrW+fpnNVw="}},"hash":"EkRWTIPFaDVjRQNHNRNicmrPytYe/qRwE+h7MFzp2h0=","text":"Prakåti itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of goodness, the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes there is eternal time, and by a combination of these modes of nature and under the control and purview of eternal time there are activities which are called karma. These activities are being carried out from time immemorial, and we are suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities. For instance, suppose I am a businessman and have worked very hard with intelligence and have amassed a great bank balance. Then I am an enjoyer. But then say I have lost all my money in business; then I am a sufferer. Similarly, in every field of life we enjoy the results of our work, or we suffer the results. This is called karma. Éçvara (the Supreme Lord), jéva (the living entity), prakåti (nature), eternal time and karma (activity) are all explained in the Bhagavad-gétä. Out of these five, the Lord, the living entities, material nature and time are eternal. The manifestation of prakåti may be temporary, but it is not false. Some philosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is false, but according to the philosophy of Bhagavad-gétä or according to the philosophy of the Vaiñëavas, this is not so. The manifestation of the world is not accepted as false; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is likened unto a cloud which moves across the sky, or the coming of the rainy season which nourishes grains. As soon as the rainy season is over and as soon as the cloud goes away, all the crops which were nourished by the rain dry up. Similarly, this material manifestation takes place at a certain interval, stays for a while and then disappears. Such are the workings of prakåti But this cycle is working eternally. Therefore prakrti is eternal; it is not false. The Lord refers to this as “My prakåti.” This material nature is the separated energy of the Supreme Lord, and similarly the living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord, but they are not separated.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"57497640-72b6-41a4-926d-27bbef7f8541":{"id_":"57497640-72b6-41a4-926d-27bbef7f8541","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"628cb66b-24de-4aa6-93cc-6a23b5d90fe8","metadata":{},"hash":"EkRWTIPFaDVjRQNHNRNicmrPytYe/qRwE+h7MFzp2h0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7194c6a6-7fbe-404e-a168-e6228046600e","metadata":{},"hash":"LTvHwCA3EcvJ0mIPZz692TNMDMhcAoncZkipTsLXOCo="}},"hash":"6f3piRjON7djDy8FE4fyHxJ90hLWlx8zegrW+fpnNVw=","text":"are not separated. They are eternally related. So the Lord, the living entity, material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal. However, the other item, karma, is not eternal. The effects of karma may be very old indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of our activities from time immemorial, but we can change the results of our karma, or our activity, and this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are engaged in various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of activities we should adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of all these activities, but this is also explained in the Bhagavad-gétä. The position of ésvara is that of supreme consciousness. The jévas, or the living entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are also conscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as prakåti, the energy of the Supreme Lord, but one of the two, the jéva, is conscious. The other prakåti is not conscious. That is the difference. Therefore the jéva-prakåti is called superior because the jéva has consciousness which is similar to the Lord’s. The Lord’s is supreme consciousness, however, and one should not claim that the jéva, the living entity, is also supremely conscious. The living being cannot be supremely conscious at any stage of his perfection, and the theory that he can be so is a misleading theory. Conscious he may be, but he is not perfectly or supremely conscious. The distinction between the jéva and the éçvara will be explained in the Thirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. The Lord is kñetra-jïaù, conscious, as is the living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body, whereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of every living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the particular jévas. We should not forget this.

The living entity forgets what to do. First of all he makes a determination to act in a certain way, and then he is entangled in the acts and reactions of his own karma. After giving up one type of body, he enters another type of body, as we put on and take off old clothes. As the soul thus migrates, he suffers the actions and reactions of his past activities. These activities can be changed when the living being is in the mode of goodness, in sanity, and understands what sort of activities he should adopt. If he does so, then all the actions and reactions of his past activities can be changed. Consequently, karma is not eternal. Therefore we stated that of the five items (éçvara, jéva, prakåti time and karma) four are eternal, whereas karma is not eternal. The supreme conscious éçvara is similar to the living entity in this way: both the consciousness of the Lord and that of the living entity are transcendental. It is not that consciousness is generated by the association of matter. That is a mistaken idea. The theory that consciousness develops under certain circumstances of material combination is not accepted in the Bhagavad-gétä. Consciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the covering of material circumstances, just as light reflected through colored glass may appear to be a certain color, but the consciousness of the Lord is not materially affected. Lord Kåñëa says, “mayädhyakñeëa prakåtiù.” When He descends into the material universe, His consciousness is not materially affected. If He were so affected, He would be unfit to speak on transcendental matters as He does in the Bhagavad-gétä. One cannot say anything about the transcendental world without being free from materially contaminated consciousness. So the Lord is not materially contaminated.

An ignorant person may see that a devotee is acting or working like an ordinary man, but such a person with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the activities of the devotee or of the Lord are not contaminated by impure consciousness or matter. They are transcendental to the three modes of nature. We should know, however, that at this point our consciousness is contaminated. When we are materially contaminated, we are called conditioned. False consciousness is exhibited under the impression that I am a product of material nature. This is called false ego. One who is absorbed in the thought of bodily conceptions cannot understand his situation. Bhagavad-gétä was spoken to liberate one from the bodily conception of life, and Arjuna put himself in this position in order to receive this information from the Lord. One must become free from the bodily conception of life; that is the preliminary activity for the transcendentalist. One who wants to become free, who wants to become liberated, must first of all learn that he is not this material body. Mukti or liberation means freedom from material consciousness. In the Çrémad- Bhägavatam also the definition of liberation is given: Mukti means liberation from the contaminated consciousness of this material world and situation in pure consciousness. All the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä are intended to awaken this pure consciousness, and therefore we find at the last stage of the Gétä’s instructions that Kåñëa is asking Arjuna whether he is now in purified consciousness.

This consciousness is “I am.” Then what am I? In contaminated consciousness “I am” means “I am the lord of all I survey. I am the enjoyer.” The world revolves because every living being thinks that he is the lord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two psychic divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the enjoyer. But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer, and the living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the creator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the created and the enjoyed. For instance, a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine; a part of the body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, feet, eyes, legs and so on are all parts of the body, but they are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is the enjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew and all parts of the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the principal factor that nourishes the body’s organization. Therefore everything is given to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one nourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a healthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as subordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This cooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help all other parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should take the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be frustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the Supreme Lord, and the living entities are cooperators.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"67d7a7a0-c8c3-4b49-964a-1c1f430ed80a":{"id_":"67d7a7a0-c8c3-4b49-964a-1c1f430ed80a","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fdef8dc5-7834-444f-86d2-e34f07cb76d8","metadata":{},"hash":"Lf0wR14d25uv085Okuz6yv2aiLx3c+B/SfB6a3mM6w4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f39d8ac4-624a-4d81-a9e3-76caeb2664f5","metadata":{},"hash":"4wYQZ4nb9xQPCQ7j63gUSrrX/3HIX51rEmw3Bv8guAI="}},"hash":"BFZLwYoot3R/rhpNxRlGzbCLOZEUvgDtsKf6ODnfQlw=","text":"Lord, and the living entities are cooperators.

Impersonal Brahman is incomplete realization of the absolute whole, and so also is the conception of Paramätmä in the Twelfth Chapter.

People with less intelligence consider the Supreme Truth to be impersonal, but He is a transcendental person, and this is confirmed in all Vedic literatures. Nityo nityänäm cetanaç cetanänäm. As we are all individual living beings and have our individuality, the Supreme Absolute Truth is also, in the ultimate issue, a person, and realization of the Personality of Godhead is realization of all of the transcendental features. The complete whole is not formless. If He is formless, or if He is less than any other thing, then He cannot be the complete whole. The complete whole must have everything within our experience and beyond our experience, otherwise it cannot be complete. The complete whole, Personality of Godhead, has immense potencies. How Kåñëa is acting in different potencies is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä. This phenomenal world or material world in which we are placed is also complete in itself because the twenty-four elements of which this material universe is a temporary manifestation, according to Säìkhya philosophy, are completely adjusted to produce complete resources which are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of this universe. There is nothing extraneous; nor is there anything needed. This manifestation has its own time fixed by the energy of the supreme whole, and when its time is complete, these temporary manifestations will be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete.

We have to receive knowledge from the proper source in disciplic succession beginning with the supreme spiritual master, the Lord Himself, and handed down to a succession of spiritual masters.

So no one should claim to be the proprietor of anything; one should accept only things which are set aside for him by the Lord as his quota for his maintenance. There are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things which are set aside for us by the Lord. This is also explained in Bhagavad-gétä. In the beginning, Arjuna decided that he should not fight in the Battle of Kurukñetra. This was his own decision. Arjuna told the Lord that it was not possible for him to enjoy the kingdom after killing his own kinsmen. This decision was based on the body because he was thinking that the body was himself and that his bodily relations or expansions were his brothers, nephews, brothers-in-law, grandfathers and so on. He was thinking in this way to satisfy his bodily demands. Bhagavad-gétä was spoken by the Lord just to change this view, and at the end Arjuna decides to fight under the directions of the Lord when he says, “kariñye vacanaà tava.” “I shall act according to Thy word.” In this world man is not meant to toil like hogs.

Animals can kill other living animals, and there is no question of sin on their part, but if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste, he must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to the different modes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of ignorance. Similarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in goodness, passion and ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we properly utilize the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä, then our whole life will become purified, and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination which is beyond this material sky. That destination is called the sanätana sky, the eternal spiritual sky. In this material world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into being, stays for some time, produces some by-products, dwindles and then vanishes. That is the law of the material world, whether we use as an example this body, or a piece of fruit or anything. But beyond this temporary world there is another world of which we have information. This world consists of another nature which is sanätana, eternal. Jéva is also described as sanätana, eternal, and the Lord is also described as sanätana in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an intimate relationship with the Lord, and because we are all qualitatively one―the sanätana-dhäma, or sky, the sanätana Supreme Personality and the sanätana living entities―the whole purpose of Bhagavad-gétä is to revive our sanätana occupation, or sanätana-dharma, which is the eternal occupation of the living entity.

The Lord is very kind to the living entities because they are His sons. Lord Kåñëa declares in Bhagavad-gétä, “sarva-yoniñu...ahaà béja-pradaù pitä.” “I am the father of all.” Of course there are all types of living entities according to their various karmas, but here the Lord claims that He is the father of all of them. Therefore the Lord descends to reclaim all of these fallen, conditioned souls to call them back to the sanätana eternal sky so that the sanätana living entities may regain their eternal sanätana positions in eternal association with the Lord. The Lord comes Himself in different incarnations, or He sends His confidential servants as sons or His associates or äcäryas to reclaim the conditioned souls. Therefore, sanätana-dharma does not refer to any sectarian process of religion. It is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relationship with the eternal Supreme Lord. Sanätana-dharma refers, as stated previously, to the eternal occupation of the living entity. Rämänujäcärya has explained the word sanätana as “that which has neither beginning nor end,” so when we speak of sanätana-dharma, we must take it for granted on the authority of Çré Rämänujäcärya that it has neither beginning nor end. The English word “religion” is a little different from sanätana-dharma. Religion conveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have faith in a particular process, and he may change this faith and adopt another, but sanätana-dharma refers to that activity which cannot be changed. For instance, liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat be taken from fire. Similarly, the eternal function of the eternal living entity cannot be taken from the living entity. Sanätana-dharma is eternally integral with the living entity.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"086aa803-b7a9-4deb-90c2-22e745b95c1d":{"id_":"086aa803-b7a9-4deb-90c2-22e745b95c1d","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c2c177a8-9155-46d6-a8fd-e0108e7ff5ff","metadata":{},"hash":"JfMBvcPb8w6chZhqyZ9RTkkRNeW1jf8h3wE9DySgpgc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3a40558f-0690-4a53-aca1-02d85ec41757","metadata":{},"hash":"Vu/CfCGh4j94nY2MNtqzrwLoCX9EeonZnCeQg/hLTfA="}},"hash":"TUcN+z9WEANFUCf4mOP4ERC5EhdHNAWEoPwRxkByOxY=","text":"Sanätana-dharma is eternally integral with the living entity.

Non-sanätana religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of human history, but there is no beginning to the history of sanätana-dharma because it remains eternally with the living entities. Insofar as the living entities are concerned, the authoritative çästras state that the living entity has neither birth nor death. In the Gétä it is stated that the living entity is never born, and he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he continues to live after the destruction of his temporary material body. In reference to the concept of sanätana-dharma, we must try to understand the concept of religion from the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. Dharma refers to that which is constantly existing with the particular object. We conclude that there is heat and light along with the fire; without heat and light, there is no meaning to the word fire. Similarly, we must discover the essential part of the living being, that part which is his constant companion. That constant companion is his eternal quality, and that eternal quality is his eternal religion. When Sanätana Gosvämé asked Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu about the svarüpa of every living being, the Lord replied that the svarüpa or constitutional position of the living being is the rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we analyze this statement of Lord Caitanya, we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in rendering service to another living being.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"3a40558f-0690-4a53-aca1-02d85ec41757":{"id_":"3a40558f-0690-4a53-aca1-02d85ec41757","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"086aa803-b7a9-4deb-90c2-22e745b95c1d","metadata":{},"hash":"TUcN+z9WEANFUCf4mOP4ERC5EhdHNAWEoPwRxkByOxY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e41f6f16-02ac-487b-aee5-71fb128eb09a","metadata":{},"hash":"5/NQalEcJAqkvNIpsX6XGIjICUZD5+AgVbXzTJU8Kug="}},"hash":"Vu/CfCGh4j94nY2MNtqzrwLoCX9EeonZnCeQg/hLTfA=","text":"easily see that every living being is constantly engaged in rendering service to another living being. A living being serves other living beings in two capacities. By doing so, the living entity enjoys life. The lower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master. A serves B master, B serves C master and C serves D master and so on. Under these circumstances, we can see that one friend serves another friend, the mother serves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband serves the wife and so on. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is no exception in the society of living beings to the activity of service. The politician presents his manifesto for the public to convince them of his capacity for service. The voters therefore give the politician their valuable votes, thinking that he will render valuable service to society. The shopkeeper serves the customer, and the artisan serves the capitalist. The capitalist serves the family, and the family serves the state in the terms of the eternal capacity of the eternal living being. In this way we can see that no living being is exempt from rendering service to other living beings, and therefore we can safely conclude that service is the constant companion of the living being and that the rendering of service is the eternal religion of the living being. Yet man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference to particular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or any other sect. Such designations are non-sanätana- dharma. A Hindu may change his faith to become a Muslim, or a Muslim may change his faith to become a Hindu, or a Christian may change his faith and so on. But in all circumstances the change of religious faith does not effect the eternal occupation of rendering service to others. The Hindu, Muslim or Christian in all circumstances is servant of someone. Thus, to profess a particular type of sect is not to profess one’s sanätana-dharma.

A man dies after it has been decided what form of body he will have in the next life. Higher authorities, not the living entity himself, make this decision. According to our activities in this life, we either rise or sink. This life is a preparation for the next life. If we can prepare, therefore, in this life to get promotion to the kingdom of God, then surely, after quitting this material body, we will attain a spiritual body just like the Lord. As explained before, there are different kinds of transcendentalists, the brahmavädi paramätmävädi and the devotee, and, as mentioned, in the brahmajyoti (spiritual sky) there are innumerable spiritual planets. The number of these planets is far, far greater than all of the planets of this material world. This material world has been approximated as only one quarter of the creation. In this material segment there are millions and billions of universes with trillions of planets and suns, stars and moons. But this whole material creation is only a fragment of the total creation.

There are so many literatures which fill our thoughts with the material energy—newspapers, novels, etc. Our thinking, which is now absorbed in these literatures, must be transferred to the Vedic literatures. The great sages, therefore, have written so many Vedic literatures such as the Puräëas, etc. The Puräëas are not imaginative; they are historical records. In the Caitanya- caritämåta there is the following verse: mäyä mugdha jéver nähi svataù kåñëa-jïäna jévera kåpäya kailä kåñëa veda-puräëa (Cc.

Just to transfer their thinking power to the spiritual sky, Kåñëa has given a great number of Vedic literatures. First He divided the Vedas into four, then He explained them in the Puräëas, and for less capable people He wrote the Mahäbhärata. In the Mahäbhärata there is given the Bhagavad-gétä. Then all Vedic literature is summarized in the Vedänta-sütra, and for future guidance He gave a natural commentation on the Vedänta- sutra, called Çrémad-Bhägavatam.

No, the Lord never suggests anything impractical. In this material world, in order to maintain the body one has to work. Human society is divided, according to work, into four divisions of social order—brähmaëa, kñatriya, vaiçya, çüdra. The brähmaëa class or intelligent class is working in one way, the kñatriya or administrative class is working in another way, and the mercantile class and the laborers are all tending to their specific duties. In the human society, whether one is a laborer, merchant, warrior, administrator, or farmer, or even if one belongs to the highest class and is a literary man, a scientist or a theologian, he has to work in order to maintain his existence. The Lord therefore tells Arjuna that he need not give up his occupation, but while he is engaged in his occupation he should remember Kåñëa. If he doesn’t practice remembering Kåñëa while he is struggling for existence, then it will not be possible for him to remember Kåñëa at the time of death. Lord Caitanya also advises this. He says that one should practice remembering the Lord by chanting the names of the Lord always. The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"2051672e-0b4c-4ff7-bd49-d3d9890af341":{"id_":"2051672e-0b4c-4ff7-bd49-d3d9890af341","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6dcc2b69-32a8-4a54-a9cd-d53bb6fe4b0b","metadata":{},"hash":"Qikz99YbN1QEoe7dUNWiJ0HojqWGgokH3QtGCy0iurQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"05b0460a-9be7-4561-8187-a0817e16ab57","metadata":{},"hash":"8yEXxh9W+sITmJuOaOyx7rqMKxyWJkbCtP/9erQc5rk="}},"hash":"bB0npDssIKCajMrZ+48svaMCe87HYtA4xEvyWbR39jg=","text":"The names of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent. So Lord Kåñëa’s instruction to Arjuna to “remember Me” and Lord Caitanya’s injunction to always “chant the names of Lord Kåñëa” are the same instruction. There is no difference, because Kåñëa and Kåñëa’s name are nondifferent. In the absolute status there is no difference between reference and referent. Therefore we have to practice remembering the Lord always, twenty-four hours a day, by chanting His names and molding our life’s activities in such a way that we can remember Him always. How is this possible? The äcäryas give the following example. If a married woman is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman other than his wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One with such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is thinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting him, even while she is carrying out her household chores. In fact, she carries out her household work even more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly, we should always remember the supreme lover, Çré Kåñëa, and at the same time perform our material duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here. If we have a strong sense of love for the Supreme Lord, then we can discharge our duty and at the same time remember Him. But we have to develop that sense of love. Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of Kåñëa; he was the constant companion of Kåñëa, and at the same time he was a warrior. Kåñëa did not advise him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When Lord Kåñëa delineates the yoga system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practice of this system is not possible for him. arjuna uväca yo ’yaà yogas tvayä proktaù sämyena madhusüdana etasyähaà na paçyämi caïcalatvät sthitià sthiräm","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"05b0460a-9be7-4561-8187-a0817e16ab57":{"id_":"05b0460a-9be7-4561-8187-a0817e16ab57","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2051672e-0b4c-4ff7-bd49-d3d9890af341","metadata":{},"hash":"bB0npDssIKCajMrZ+48svaMCe87HYtA4xEvyWbR39jg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d504b90f-1d34-4532-9238-3c37e5a08931","metadata":{},"hash":"OKfB9O3HrUzoYX+JjuMDcsn+xhwbqERBpXrD49YNpyU="}},"hash":"8yEXxh9W+sITmJuOaOyx7rqMKxyWJkbCtP/9erQc5rk=","text":"“Arjuna said, O Madhusüdana, the system of yoga which you have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady.” (Bg. 6.33) But the Lord says: yoginäm api sarveñäà mad-gatenäntarätmanä çraddhävän bhajate yo mäà sa me yuktatamo mataù “Of all yogés, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga, and is the highest of all.” (Bg. 6.47) So one who thinks of the Supreme Lord always is the greatest yogé, the supermost jïäné, and the greatest devotee at the same time. The Lord further tells Arjuna that as a kñatriya he cannot give up his fighting, but if Arjuna fights remembering Kåñëa, then he will be able to remember Him at the time of death. But one must be completely surrendered in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. We work not with our body, actually, but with our mind and intelligence. So if the intelligence and the mind are always engaged in the thought of the Supreme Lord, then naturally the senses are also engaged in His service. Superficially, at least, the activities of the senses remain the same, but the consciousness is changed. The Bhagavad-gétä teaches one how to absorb the mind and intelligence in the thought of the Lord. Such absorption will enable one to transfer himself to the kingdom of the Lord. If the mind is engaged in Kåñëa’s service, then the senses are automatically engaged in His service. This is the art, and this is also the secret of Bhagavad-gétä: total absorption in the thought of Çré Kåñëa.

The example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad- gétä itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the Gétä directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-gétä in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-gétä all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the Gétä. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa. The topics discussed by Dhåtaräñöra and Saïjaya, as described in the Mahäbhärata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind. The word dharma-kñetra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is significant because, on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dhåtaräñöra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons’ ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Saïjaya, “What did my sons and the sons of Päëòu do?” He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother Päëòu were assembled in that Field of Kurukñetra for a determined engagement of the war.

Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kurukñetra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship―even for the denizens of heaven―Dhåtaräñöra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of Päëòu favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Saïjaya was a student of Vyäsa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vyäsa, Saïjaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kurukñetra even while he was in the room of Dhåtaräñöra. And so, Dhåtaräñöra asked him about the situation on the battlefield. Both the Päëòavas and the sons of Dhåtaräñöra belong to the same family, but Dhåtaräñöra’s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of Päëòu from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dhåtaräñöra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of Päëòu. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kurukñetra where the father of religion, Çré Kåñëa, was present, the unwanted plants like Dhåtaräñöra’s son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhiñöhira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-kñetre and kuru-kñetre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.

Duryodhana clearly felt that the victory of the Kurus depended on the presence of Bhéñmadeva. He was confident of the full support of Bhéñmadeva and Droëäcärya in the battle because he well knew that they did not even speak a word when Arjuna’s wife Draupadé, in her helpless condition, had appealed to them for justice while she was being forced to strip naked in the presence of all the great generals in the assembly. Although he knew that the two generals had some sort of affection for the Päëòavas, he hoped that all such affection would now be completely given up by them, as was customary during the gambling performances.

But, He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of Håñékeça. The Lord has different names according to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhusüdana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is Väsudeva because He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devaké-nandana because He accepted Devaké as His mother; His name is Yaçodä-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Yaçodä at Våndävana; His name is Pärtha-särathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is Håñékeça because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. Arjuna is referred to as Dhanaïjaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the King to make expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bhéma is known as Våkodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform Herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hiòimba. So, the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the Päëòavas, beginning with the Lord’s, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord Kåñëa, the supreme director, nor that of the goddess of fortune. So, they were predestined to lose the battle―and that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells.

PURPORT Although Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless mercy He was engaged in the service of His friend. He never fails in His affection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed herein as infallible. As charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did not hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. Although He had accepted the position of a charioteer for His devotee, His supreme position was not challenged. In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Håñékeça, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and His servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to render a service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in His pure devotee’s assuming the advantageous position of ordering Him than He does in being the giver of orders.

O maintainer of all creatures, I am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth. PURPORT Arjuna has addressed Lord Kåñëa as Govinda because Kåñëa is the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna indicates what will satisfy his senses. Although Govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the opposite way—namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without desiring to satisfy one’s own senses—then by the grace of Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna’s deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"0f78d4a4-e7f2-454a-a9e0-9be981256055":{"id_":"0f78d4a4-e7f2-454a-a9e0-9be981256055","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"66d847e1-aadc-4930-b5e4-5e8609230c30","metadata":{},"hash":"H8gICDIVuke0IeY/GEJMs2A6Fcs9QLHr473SaEQO7Jo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f3d8fedb-16a1-4f6e-a236-491426be940d","metadata":{},"hash":"CnNM2fF9Rkvmg6TBXZQ4kncwwXAUVGJvj9TK4RuA3ZE="}},"hash":"y/6WAU4z1HtTy0WLyqfbfKEvSc76ZE0XXuj/AnN8I1M=","text":"them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed in the battlefield, and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that Kåñëa kill them personally. At this point he did not know that Kåñëa had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for Kåñëa. This fact is disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord’s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna wanted to excuse them.

PURPORT According to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: 1) a poison giver, 2) one who sets fire to the house, 3) one who attacks with deadly weapons, 4) one who plunders riches, 5) one who occupies another’s land, and 6) one who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite befitting for any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a kñatriya. Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly.

For example, Lord Räma was so saintly that people were anxious to live in His kingdom, (Räma-räjya), but Lord Räma never showed any cowardice. Rävaëa was an aggressor against Räma because he kidnapped Räma’s wife, Sétä, but Lord Räma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna’s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna’s addressing of Kåñëa as “Mädhava,” or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to Kåñëa that, as husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not have to induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. Kåñëa, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees.

The elder members are responsible for such purifying processes in the family, beginning from birth to death. But on the death of the elder members, such family traditions of purification may stop, and the remaining younger family members may develop irreligious habits and thereby lose their chance for spiritual salvation. Therefore, for no purpose should the elder members of the family be slain.

TRANSLATION When irreligion is prominent in the family, O Kåñëa, the women of the family become corrupt, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Våñëi, comes unwanted progeny. PURPORT Good population in human society is the basic principle for peace, prosperity and spiritual progress in life. The varëäçrama religion’s principles were so designed that the good population would prevail in society for the general spiritual progress of state and community. Such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family. By being engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery. According to Cäëakya Paëòit, women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy. So, the different family traditions of religious activities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the varëäçrama system. On the failure of such varëäçrama-dharma, naturally the women become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population. Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, and thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence.

PURPORT According to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a need to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family. This offering is performed by worship of Viñëu, because eating the remnants of food offered to Viñëu can deliver one from all kinds of sinful actions. Sometimes the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants of prasädam food are offered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly or other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals. One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such actions.

The word “Madhusüdana” is significant in this verse.

Bhagavän is the ultimate in the Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Paramätmä, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagavän, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kåñëa. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus: vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaà yaj jïänam advayam brahmeti paramätmeti bhagavän iti çabdyate. “The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramätmä, and Bhagavän.” (Bhäg. 1.2.11) These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun’s surface and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun’s surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine—its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature—may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Paramätmä feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth.

The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category. The Sanskrit word Bhagavän is explained by the great authority, Paräçara Muni, the father of Vyäsadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagavän. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only Kåñëa can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahmä, Lord Çiva, or Näräyaëa, can possess opulences as fully as Kåñëa. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-saàhitä by Lord Brahmä himself that Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavän, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes. éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid-änanda-vigrahaù anädir ädir govindaù sarua-käraëa-käraëam “There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavän, but Kåñëa is the supreme because none can excel Him.

In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna’s lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Kåñëa expressed His surprise with the word kutas, “wherefrom.” Such unmanly sentiments were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Äryans. The word äryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Viñëu, or Bhagavän, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-Äryans. Although Arjuna was a kñatriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-Äryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord Kåñëa did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen.

PURPORT Arjuna was addressed as the “son of Påthä,” who happened to be the sister of Kåñëa’s father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with Kåñëa.

In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse. Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the problems of life.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"8039cb72-941e-4e7c-a312-cd3798d55400":{"id_":"8039cb72-941e-4e7c-a312-cd3798d55400","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f14d7676-eb22-4213-afc5-7f1909845219","metadata":{},"hash":"7/qyMuS8dlPRzuzX8x4GlAnW9uIIO1JMsxkuH3Rq6hk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c90fae09-a465-4bc9-b5f7-803777b06302","metadata":{},"hash":"LE/Br2/VimLqrmYMmFPI6rmLadJZmVMzc7bGY9J3iM4="}},"hash":"5Fs/VZ/qZc7n1p4iNQ1XRCBLyqd9KxDl6sR0IvB22ug=","text":"It is he who does not understand the problems of life.

On the other hand, there is the brähmaëa, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life. The kåpaëas, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of “skin disease.” The kåpaëa thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the kåpaëa thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes ot his perplexities. Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord Kåñëa, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to Kåñëa as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks.

They are seeking peace in different ways, but they ean achieve real happiness only if they consult Kåñëa, or the Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam—which constitute the science of Kåñëa—or the bona fide representative of Kåñëa, the man in Kåñëa consciousness. If economic development and material comforts could drive away one’s lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be able to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in Kåñëa consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking a place on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The Bhagavad-gétä confirms this: kñéëe puëye martyalokaà viçanti “When the results of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life.” Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation. Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of Kåñëa, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked Kåñëa to solve his problem definitely, and that is the way of Kåñëa consciousness.

As friends, both of them were on the same level, but one of them voluntarily became a student of the other. Kåñëa was smiling because a friend had chosen to become a disciple. As Lord of all, He is always in the superior position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord accepts one who wishes to be a friend, a son, a lover or a devotee, or who wants Him in such a role. But when He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the master—with gravity, as it is required. It appears that the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the presence of both armies so that all were benefitted. So the talks of Bhagavad-gétä are not for any particular person, society, or community, but they are for all, and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them.

The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna, and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield, are eternally individual beings and that the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned as well as in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord’s eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual, eternal persons. It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption. Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone. The Mäyävädé theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of mäyä or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord Kåñëa, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. Kåñëa clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the Upaniñads, will continue eternally. This statement of Kåñëa is authoritative because Kåñëa cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality is not a fact, then Kåñëa would not have stressed it so much—even for the future. The Mäyävädé may argue that the individuality spoken of by Kåñëa is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish Kåñëa’s individuality?

A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing. The Gétä is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-gétä. When one accepts Kåñëa as an ordinary man, the Gétä loses all importance. The Mäyävädé argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for Kåñëa to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great äcäryas like Çré Rämänuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the Gétä that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee’s approach to the teachings of the Géta is something like bees licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the Bhagavad-gétä can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the Gétä be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the Mäyävädé explanation of the Gétä is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth.

Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul being unchangeable. As confirmed in the Gétä, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally (sanätana) and are called kñara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation, the individual soul remains the same―fragmental.

PURPORT Anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of spiritual realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and happiness is certainly a person eligible for liberation. In the varëäçrama institution, the fourth stage of life, namely the renounced order (sannyäsa) is a painstaking situation. But one who is serious about making his life perfect surely adopts the sannyäsa order of life in spite of all difficulties. The difficulties usually arise from having to sever family relationships, to give up the connection of wife and children. But if anyone is able to tolerate such difficulties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete. Similarly, in Arjuna’s discharge of duties as a kñatriya, he is advised to persevere, even if it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons.

So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading Viñëu-tattva. The influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body. According to the Muëòaka Upaniñad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away from this position, activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul.

In Manu-saàhitä, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed.

From old age, the change is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in the previous verse. Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul.The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Muëòaka Upaniñad, as well as the Çvetäçvatara Upanisad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (Kåñëa) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds―although they are the same in quality―one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. Kåñëa is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one’s changing his position from one tree to another or from one body to another. The jéva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master―as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto Kåñëa for instruction―the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Kaöha Upaniñad and Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad confirm this: samäne våkñe puruño nimagno ’néçayä çocati muhyamänaù juñöaà yadä paçyaty anyam éçam asya mahimänam iti véta-çokaù","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"09cbd5f1-a085-4036-b38e-f9ad046e3f6d":{"id_":"09cbd5f1-a085-4036-b38e-f9ad046e3f6d","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9fe328c3-edb4-4d76-8dbf-8a2c8d1f097d","metadata":{},"hash":"NgpYv8ySx+/qB89P4cjv7H8TmXPzfHmQXETCYCl5Csk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"acec4dc7-84fe-4989-8274-933c11595749","metadata":{},"hash":"A6DEjM85fxcJnMkQ1WIi0YOIGZyBaDUZw62J4aqk1Q4="}},"hash":"5fz0tmys4H2mcio90hAaM0DqrJOdxT5CT1EHG4JKx7w=","text":"mahimänam iti véta-çokaù “Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree.

And thus, hearing from Kåñëa, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation. Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for Arjuna’s lamentation.

PURPORT All kinds of weapons, swords, flames, rains, tornadoes, etc., are unable to kill the spirit soul. It appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of earth, water, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons of fire. Even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but formerly there were other weapons made of all different types of material elements. Firearms were counteracted by water weapons, which are now unknown to modern science. Nor do modern scientists have knowledge of tornado weapons. Nonetheless, the soul can never be cut into pieces, nor annihilated by any number of weapons, regardless of scientific devices. Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Soul. The Mäyävädé, however, cannot describe how the individual soul evolved from ignorance and consequently became covered by illusory energy. Because they are atomic individual souls (sanätana) eternally, they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of the fire, although one in quality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire. In the Varäha Puräëa, the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme. They are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-gétä also. So, even after being liberated from illusion, the living entity remains a separate identity, as is evident from the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna. Arjuna became liberated by the knowledge received from Kåñëa, but he never became one with Kåñëa.

PURPORT All these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the individual soul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole, and he remains the same atom eternally, without change. The theory of monism is very difficult to apply in this case, because the individual soul is never expected to become one homogeneously. After liberation from material contamination, the atomic soul may prefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual planets to associate with the Personality of Godhead. The word sarva-gataù (all-pervading) is significant because there is no doubt that living entities are all over God’s creation. They live on the land, in the water, in the air, within the earth and even within fire. The belief that they are sterilized in fire is not acceptable, because it is clearly stated here that the soul cannot be burned by fire. Therefore, there is no doubt that there are living entities also in the sun planet with suitable bodies to live there. If the sun globe is uninhabited, then the word sarva-gataù―living everywhere―becomes meaningless.

We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception.

There is no other source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no other source of understanding the soul except by studying the Vedas.

According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo-religions— now becoming fashionable in America—are also adhering to this philosophy, as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects. Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul―as in the Vaibhäñika philosophy―there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientific warfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the Vaibhäñika philosophy, the so-called soul or ätmä vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul, or whether he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for such an incidence. However, since he was not risking rebirth of the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, Kåñëa sarcastically addressed Arjuna as mahä-bähu, mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibhäñikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom. As a kñatriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles.

In this way the cycle of birth and death is revolving, one after the other without liberation. This cycle of birth and death does not, however, support unnecessary murder, slaughter and war.

Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for argument’s sake, we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested—that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"b4f42065-880a-48d8-97b9-7cf44510e315":{"id_":"b4f42065-880a-48d8-97b9-7cf44510e315","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"865dc5a0-fd71-4a40-aef3-888c73bd1280","metadata":{},"hash":"r7XtNZaE5Th0/kvLBTbvREP5iNI4EGmYP8NJddu0X1A="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"41dd7e4e-be1b-424e-a541-4b59a4d7cee4","metadata":{},"hash":"JRL5nhjIBOGjCVXzPjVJBiRm0jIozRL8vsJNeCQZQAM="}},"hash":"5dTxyfHL1KOfFdE2FA1xlK6FsSO+3m7+pgt30zzfsDE=","text":"make any real material difference.

The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body.

Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self- understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps one has no idea that one must think of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries.

Kñat means hurt. One who gives protection from harm is called kñatriya (trayate—to give protection). The kñatriyas are trained for killing in the forest. A kñatriya would go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of cremation. This system is being followed even up to the present day by the kñatriya kings of Jaipur state. The kñatriyas are specially trained for challenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore, kñatriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of sannyäsa or renunciation. Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or principle. In the religious law books it is stated: ähaveñu mitho ’nyonyaà jighäàsanto mahékñitaù yuddhamänäù paraà çaktyä svargaà yänty aparäìmukhäù yajïeñu paçavo brahman hanyante satataà dvijaiù saàskåtäù kila mantraiç ca te ’pi svargam aväpnuvan. “In the battlefield, a king or kñatriya, while fighting another king envious of him, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the brähmaëas also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire.” Therefore, killing on the battle on the religious principle and the killing of animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts of violence, because everyone is benefitted by the religious principles involved. The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the kñatriyas killed in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the brähmaëas who attain them by offering sacrifice.

Svadharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter. On the bodily plane svadharma is called varëäçrama-dharma, or man’s steppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the stage of varëäçrama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body obtained.

O son of Påthä, when you act by such intelligence, you can free yourself from the bondage of works. PURPORT According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, saìkhya means that which describes phenomena in detail, and saìkhya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses. Arjuna’s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom by conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dhåtaräñöra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of persona1 sense gratification, for there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. Kåñëa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally, and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners. But, actually, we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord Kåñëa. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as säìkhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This säìkhya has nothing to do with the säìkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"de30f385-0bea-43ad-a6e6-62cea28ef765":{"id_":"de30f385-0bea-43ad-a6e6-62cea28ef765","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b4cc7d44-be3f-453c-ad66-6f52b9800409","metadata":{},"hash":"q4R5B1W+R78HN9AJbCrAPHzLBNRbvYIbuwqBp4GlsnM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"983e84c1-8e86-4217-b3ff-ba287bda7a2e","metadata":{},"hash":"YEa7/dmmRXvgLVKqXG2OoS4z+HuUWdDOyPaqnLZ1jCI="}},"hash":"up7i88aHzfvZx4/z01vPBn+jrYlK0RJokqpYTzB0ys8=","text":"Long before the imposter Kapila’s säìkhya, the säìkhya philosophy was expounded in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Kåñëa, who explained it to His mother, Devahüti. It is clearly explained by Him that the Puruña, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prakåti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in the Gétä. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prakåti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individuals souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of mäyä or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto Väsudeva, Lord Kåñëa, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth. Arjuna has already accepted Kåñëa as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: çiñyas te ’haà çädhi mäà tväà prapannam. Consequently, Kåñëa will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma- yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Paramätmä in everyone’s heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service.

Here, säìkhya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord Kåñëa made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord Kåñëa’s säìkhya and Lord Kapila’s säìkhya, as described in the Bhägavatam; are one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga. He said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between säìkhya-yoga and bhakti-yoga. Of course, atheistic säìkhya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic säìkhya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-gétä. One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in Kåñëa consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service.

Service in Kåñëa consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Kåñëa, who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in Kåñëa consciousness. As such, to be well-versed in Kåñëa consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of Kåñëa, and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one’s mission in life. Çréla Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkur instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows: yasya prasädäd bhagavat-prasädo yasyäprasädänna gatiù kuto ’pi dhyäyaà stuvaàs tasya yaças tri-sandhyaà vande guroù çré-caraëäravindam. “By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of Kåñëa consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.” The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body—not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities. One who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts.

PURPORT People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-käëòa portions of the Vedas. They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common. In the Vedas many sacrifices are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the jyotiñöoma sacrifices. In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of Kåñëa consciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, similarly unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof. In the karma-käëòa section of the Vedas it is said that those who perform the four monthly penances become eligible to drink the somarasa beverages to become immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have somarasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called nandana-känana in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of somarasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world.

PURPORT All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Kåñëa, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedänta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijïäsä, or questions on the Supreme Transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-käëòa chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upaniñads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gétä is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahäbhärata. The Upaniñads mark the beginning of transcendental life. As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Kåñëa consciousness when one is fully dependant on the good will of Kåñëa","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"3b81cf19-88b3-4b3e-97c0-c5639002b362":{"id_":"3b81cf19-88b3-4b3e-97c0-c5639002b362","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e37aa8be-1a7d-457e-a4d9-9f7fe09d3119","metadata":{},"hash":"IFPqIFv6iCIHC68sfEIXeFGmQIqqGJzgrqi4WOiW8tI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c5658ee7-e5f1-4326-b11c-b4a343deb14e","metadata":{},"hash":"c4LwclPea2ayRSQWNoH3mVm0VOfqKkwbx+ASwi8PrHU="}},"hash":"N0UYlC3dY+PS6AFH0TSNvnFjybsWewcgyjfL9OPSWDE=","text":"on the good will of Kåñëa TEXT 46 YaavaNaQaR odPaaNae SavRTa\" SaMPl/uTaaedke- ) TaavaNSaveRzu vedezu b]aø<aSYa ivJaaNaTa\" )) 46 )) yävän artha udapäne sarvataù samplutodake tävän sarveñu vedeñu brähmaëasya vijänataù yävän—all that; arthaù—is meant; udapäne—in a well of water; sarvataù—in all respects; sampluta-udake—in a great reservoir of water; tävän—similarly; sarveñu—in all; vedeñu—Vedic literatures; brähmaëasya—of the man who knows the Supreme Brahman; vijänataù—of one who is in complete knowledge.

PURPORT The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-käëòa division of the Vedic literature are to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gétä (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord Kåñëa, the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding Kåñëa and one’s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities with Kåñëa is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. The living entities are parts and parcels of Kåñëa; therefore, revival of Kåñëa consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge.

It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals and the injunctions of the Vedäntas and the Upaniñads. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prakäçänanda Sarasvaté, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Vedänta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master found Him to be a great fool, and thus he asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord Kåñëa. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In this age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand Vedänta philosophy; the best purpose of Vedänta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"af8a2412-95b2-4d3e-8bb7-58a83c62b2db":{"id_":"af8a2412-95b2-4d3e-8bb7-58a83c62b2db","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c5658ee7-e5f1-4326-b11c-b4a343deb14e","metadata":{},"hash":"c4LwclPea2ayRSQWNoH3mVm0VOfqKkwbx+ASwi8PrHU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4a57449a-280c-4cf3-abfc-e0e3d6f79f87","metadata":{},"hash":"Jd/yLtFnFW2v0e48cK6Lkbm0kW9dvA6oYox8/o9U5NQ="}},"hash":"lcXTmbWmYP1XZx9K4ym8gu5BFv163SXPi7IKk4fqQhM=","text":"chanting the holy name of the Lord.

The following of Kåñëa’s dictation is real yoga, and this is practiced in the process called Kåñëa consciousness. By Kåñëa consciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship.

One should therefore never desire to be the cause of work. Everything should be done in Kåñëa consciousness for the satisfaction of Kåñëa. Misers do not know how to utilize the assets of riches which they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor. One should spend all energies working in Kåñëa consciousness, and that will make one’s life successful.

The Bhägavatam says: samäçritä ye padapallava-plavaà mahat-padaà puëya-yaço muräreù bhävambudhir vatsa-padaà paraà padaà paraà padaà yad vipadäà na teñäm (Bhäg. 10.14.58) “For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mukunda or the giver of mukti, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf’s hoofprint. Param padam, or the place where there are no material miseries, or Vaikuëöha, is his goal, not the place where there is danger in every step of life.” Owing to ignorance, one does not know that this material world is a miserable place where there are dangers at every step. Out of ignorance only, less intelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive activities, thinking that resultant actions will make them happy. They do not know that no kind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life without miseries. The miseries of life, namely birth, death, old age and diseases, are present everywhere within the material world. But one who understands his real constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the position of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the Vaikuëöha planets, where there is neither material, miserable life, nor the influence of time and death. To know one’s constitutional position means to know also the sublime position of the Lord.

When a person factually understands Kåñëa and his relationship with Kåñëa, he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced brähmaëa.

Now wherever I sit, I can remember the great descendant of the Yadu dynasty [Kåñëa], the enemy of Kaàsa, and thereby I can free myself from all sinful bondage. I think this is sufficient for me.” The Vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes: comprehending all kinds of prayer three times a day, taking a bath early in the morning, offering respects to the forefathers, etc. But, when one is fully in Kåñëa consciousness and is engaged in His transcendental loving service, one becomes indifferent to all these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection. If one can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord Kåñëa, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as recommended in revealed scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood that the purpose of the Vedas is to reach Kåñëa and simply engages in the rituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements.

The highest perfection of self-realization is to understand that one is eternally the servitor of Kåñëa and that one’s only business is to discharge one’s duties in Kåñëa consciousness. A Kåñëa conscious person, or unflinching devotee of the Lord, should not be disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas nor be engaged in fruitive activities for promotion to the heavenly kingdom. In Kåñëa consciousness, one comes directly into communion with Kåñëa, and thus all directions from Kåñëa may be understood in that transcendental state. One is sure to achieve results by such activities and attain conclusive knowledge. One has only to carry out the orders of Kåñëa or His representative, the spiritual master.

TRANSLATION One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws his limbs within the shell, is to be understood as truly situated in knowledge. PURPORT The test of a yogé, devotee, or self-realized soul is that he is able to control the senses according to his plan. Most people, however, are servants of the senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer to the question as to how the yogé is situated. The senses are compared to venomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The yogé, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents—like a snake charmer. He never allows them to act independantly. There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not’s, and some of them are do’s. Unless one is able to follow the do’s and the do-not’s, restricting oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in Kåñëa consciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at any moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes. Similarly, the senses of the Kåñëa conscious persons are used only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are withdrawn otherwise. Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within.

But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness. PURPORT Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense enjoyment. The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions, nor loses his taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like añöäìga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära, dharaëä, dhyäna, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa, in the course of his advancement in Kåñëa consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for Kåñëa consciousness. When one is actually Kåñëa conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things.

TRANSLATION The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them. PURPORT There are many learned sages, philosophers and transcendentalists who try to conquer the senses, but in spite of their endeavors, even the greatest of them sometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to the agitated mind. Even Viçvämitra, a great sage and perfect yogé, was misled by Menakä into sex enjoyment, although the yogé was endeavoring for sense control with severe types of penance and yoga practice. And,of course, there are so many similar instances in the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind and the senses without being fully Kåñëa conscious. Without engaging the mind in Kåñëa, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given by Çré Yämunäcärya, a great saint and devotee, who says: “Since my mind has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Kåñëa, and I have been enjoying an ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my face at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought.” Kåñëa consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically material enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man had satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables. Mahäräja Ambaréña also conquered a great yogé, Durväsä Muni, simply because his mind was engaged in Kåñëa consciousness.

On the other hand, the King, although not as powerful a yogé as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage’s injustices and thereby emerged victorious.

How one can become a mat-paraù is described in the life of Mahäräja Ambaréña.

In the material world everyone, including Lord Çiva and Lord Brahmä—to say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets—is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become Kåñëa conscious.

For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat.

PURPORT Although the vast ocean is always filled with water, it is always, especially during the rainy season, being filled with much more water. But the ocean remains the same—steady; it is not agitated, nor does it cross beyond the limit of its brink. That is also true of a person fixed in Kåñëa consciousness. As long as one has the material body, the demands of the body for sense gratification will continue. The devotee, however, is not disturbed by such desires because of his fullness. A Kåñëa conscious man is not in need of anything because the Lord fulfills all his material necessities. Therefore he is like the ocean—always full in himself. Desires may come to him like the waters of the rivers that flow into the ocean, but he is steady in his activities, and he is not even slightly disturbed by desires for sense gratification. That is the proof of a Kåñëa conscious man—one who has lost all inclinations for material sense gratification, although the desires are present. Because he remains satisfied in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he can remain steady, like the ocean, and therefore enjoy full peace. Others, however, who fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation, what to speak of material success, never attain peace. The fruitive workers, the salvationists, and also the yogés who are after mystic powers, are all unhappy because of unfulfilled desires. But the person in Kåñëa consciousness is happy in the service of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not even desire liberation from the so-called material bondage. The devotees of Kåñëa have no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace.

One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because Kåñëa is the proprietor of everything, therefore everything must be used for the satisfaction of Kåñëa. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully Kåñëa conscious he fought because Kåñëa wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for Kåñëa the same Arjuna fought to his best ability.

Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes Kåñëa conscious, he at once attains the stage of Brahma-nirväëa. There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Kåñëa consciousness.

The other class of men work in Kåñëa consciousness, as it is explained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also in the 39th verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or Kåñëa consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in the 61st verse—that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, on Kåñëa), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependant, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate goal is Kåñëa, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to Kåñëa consciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-gétä. The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of Kåñëa consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting with everything in Kåñëa consciousness. Of these two, the path of Kåñëa consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process. Kåñëa consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime.

Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly adopting the fourth order of life (sannyäsa). According to the empirical philosophers, simply by adopting sannyäsa, or retiring from fruitive activities, one at once becomes as good as Näräyaëa. But Lord Kåñëa does not approve this principle. Without purification of heart, sannyäsa is simply a disturbance to the social order. On the other hand, if someone takes to the transcendental service of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (buddhi-yoga). Svalpam apy asya dharmasya träyate mahato bhayät. Even a slight performance of such a principle enables one to overcome great difficulties.

The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the çästras.

In the Vedas, there are different kinds of yajïas prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of yajïas are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis—namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess Kälé, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship of Viñëu is recommended. But ultimately, all yajïas are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least five yajïas, known as païca-mahäyajïa, are necessary. One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can manufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like meats, etc., none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life―none of them can be manufactured by the human society.

A society of thieves can never be happy because they have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yajïas.

The santas, being always in a compact of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all pleasures), or Mukunda (the giver of liberation), or Kåñëa (the all-attractive person), cannot accept anything without first offering it to the Supreme Person. Therefore, such devotees always perform yajïas in different modes of devotional service, such as çravaëam, kértanam, smaraëam, arcanam, etc., and these performances of yajïas keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in the material world. Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification, are not only thieves, but are also the eaters of all kinds of sins. How can a person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible. Therefore, in order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to perform the easy process of saìkértana-yajïa, in full Kåñëa consciousness.

By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Viñëu and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in Kåñëa consciousness, who eats only food offered to Kåñëa, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting prasädam of the Lord (food offered to Viñëu) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination. Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord.

After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead.

But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one’s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment.

There are different kinds of activities. Those who are not Kåñëa conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious work. The yajïa system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"1c3b513c-01e4-4116-954d-73b4eeb90959":{"id_":"1c3b513c-01e4-4116-954d-73b4eeb90959","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3866e7bc-9c0b-4f16-9a0e-5be132eefd5c","metadata":{},"hash":"IXw31pGQAYMnqmzS/FS9AzkXpUDxmOXp8h7i7S46B60="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8696828e-7f6d-427c-9da2-503b9c4818f2","metadata":{},"hash":"Lvf6yhNPaAgmYiTBgw8AQunklHqUb1G+nv1E/hDnf5g="}},"hash":"8PNm1Qt1o/5bE4gMmavNQslK+55JFSvQvNQ0NS9/wBc=","text":"directly carried out by the demigods.

A person, therefore, acting for Kåñëa, or in Kåñëa consciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the work, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life. Arjuna is told that he should fight in the Battle of Kurukñetra for the interest of Kåñëa because Kåñëa wanted him to fight. To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without attachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree, recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa. Vedic rituals, like prescribed sacrifices, are performed for purification of impious activities that were performed in the field of sense gratification. But action in Kåñëa consciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work. A Kåñëa conscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of Kåñëa alone. He engages in all kinds of activities, but is completely nonattached.

Being a great devotee of the Lord, he was transcendentally situated, but because he was the King of Mithila (a subdivision of Behar province in India), he had to teach his subjects how to fight righteously in battle. He and his subjects fought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation where good arguments fail. Before the Battle of Kurukñetra, every effort was made to avoid the war, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the other party was determined to fight. So for such a right cause, there is a necessity for fighting. Although one who is situated in Kåñëa consciousness may not have any interest in the world, he still works to teach the public how to live and how to act. Experienced persons in Kåñëa consciousness can act in such a way that others will follow, and this is explained in the following verse.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"3a2eb525-9098-469e-bd7c-452b5cb017b3":{"id_":"3a2eb525-9098-469e-bd7c-452b5cb017b3","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"47183dc9-11a9-4c2c-af7e-66f081188b34","metadata":{},"hash":"uZi2x+hrSA7CzXbTMVUdctf0PoJV1RGVN1mCJ24Pzlw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4c934965-d9de-467f-aedd-0f8550076534","metadata":{},"hash":"rVun6P+uhX3T6beWmyPGLLYX+PJg2pKNOy4tm1of4Ns="}},"hash":"55BfvKcgQOEHRUjmVkKEviiMZM/avEP44YyUu3CAluk=","text":"explained in the following verse.

Lord Caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly even before he begins teaching. One who teaches in that way is called äcärya, or the ideal teacher. Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles of çäçtra (scripture) to reach the common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of revealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, like Manu-saàhitä and similar others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society. Thus the leader’s teaching should be based on the principles of the standard rules as they are practiced by the great teachers. The Çrémad-Bhägavatam also affirms that one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way of progress on the path of spiritual realization.

This body is a gift of the material nature, and one who is too much attached to the bodily consciousness is called mandän, or a lazy person without understanding of spirit soul.

Social work, nationalism, and altruism are some of the activities for such materially designated persons. Under the spell of such designations, they are always busy in the material field; for them spiritual realization is a myth, and so they are not interested. Such bewildered persons may even be engaged in such primary moral principles of life as nonviolence and similar materially benevolent work. Those who are, however, enlightened in spiritual life, should not try to agitate such materially engrossed persons. Better to prosecute one’s own spiritual activities silently. Men who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in Kåñëa consciousness, and therefore Lord Kåñëa advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable time. But the devotees of the Lord are more kind than the Lord because they understand the purpose of the Lord. Consequently they undertake all kinds of risks, even to the point of approaching ignorant men to try to engage them in the acts of Kåñëa consciousness, which are absolutely necessary for the human being.

Such an injunction may make things a little difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on Kåñëa, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot be happy independant of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was, therefore, ordered by Çré Kåñëa to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the Soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully Kåñëa conscious, is called adhyätma-cetasä.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"c5458384-101f-4ac3-b06a-9c3c7ddd061a":{"id_":"c5458384-101f-4ac3-b06a-9c3c7ddd061a","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"da674d70-8cb1-4551-a203-fcc44c49b816","metadata":{},"hash":"0cXk4zEgJ97n+7dIudAbqTHO4HE3mv1rpAZsk84B7dM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a50b097e-e94c-46a1-bc7c-b4f0cdc2edf1","metadata":{},"hash":"ms8xFB3AnGhpyAVZ4H5de5UsSRkrQzL4P0kOE+4Hc18="}},"hash":"VyDlgriq3tTMRwNsKk3P0+md9xV4/knjfTdl4iqAoCA=","text":"conscious, is called adhyätma-cetasä.

Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is the real purport of mayi, or unto Me. And when one acts in such Kåñëa consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This consciousness is called nirmama, or nothing is mine.

But those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. For example, according to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than one’s wife. All other women are to be considered as one’s mother. But, in spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratifications under regulations may also lead one to go astray—as much as there is always the chance of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But action in the loving service of Kåñëa detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one should try to be detached from Kåñëa consciousness at any stage of life. The whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform of Kåñëa consciousness.

PURPORT When a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal love for Kåñëa is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the modes of passion, instead of being degraded into the modes of ignorance, are elevated to the modes of goodness by the prescribed method of Iiving and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment. The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is created by the Lord to give a facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when they are completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.

In other words, when the living entity exhibits his Kåñëa consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire covered by smoke.

Jïänam refers to knowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or, in other words, knowledge that the spirit soul is not the body. Vijïänam refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul and knowledge of one’s constitutional position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul. It is explained thus in the Çrémad- Bhägavatam: jïänaà parama-guhyaà me yad-vijïäna-samanvitam / sarahasyaà tad-aìgaà ca gåhäna gaditaà mayä: \"The knowledge of the self and the Supreme Self is very confidential and mysterious, being veiled by mäyä, but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if it is explained by the Lord Himself.\" Bhagavad-gétä gives us that knowledge, specifically knowledge of the self. The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called Kåñëa consciousness. So, from the very beginning of life one has to learn this Kåñëa consciousness, and thereby one may become fully Kåñëa conscious and act accordingly.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"4a1a5ce6-d803-4a24-af75-0d09bebd82a4":{"id_":"4a1a5ce6-d803-4a24-af75-0d09bebd82a4","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7ab08f1c-f6b9-484d-8d86-a2f28572d7fc","metadata":{},"hash":"udA9ISDpWcagsbczumxxxxWOqJH+cqCQ11aHsKT/KHI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"49a753ca-fabb-4cc5-a8aa-0e6cc19677f3","metadata":{},"hash":"XX35D6UNywt/ZXwyJxG7hAtE5YQKVzCqP3I1uYMq7xY="}},"hash":"DA/GygrxGQa3Qgg2Tu8jXjVynTmk5cGpkwWYTsyHLNY=","text":"act accordingly.

This mental attitude has already been explained. If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities.

As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in Transcendence. Of course, Kåñëa also appeared as the son of Devaké on this earth. How Kåñëa remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal, original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before Kåñëa so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That Kåñëa is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present, but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him.

Anyway, since Kåñëa is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that Kåñëa would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of Kåñëa. Therefore, when Kåñëa Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by Kåñëa Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study Kåñëa from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of Kåñëa when they are spoken by Kåñëa Himself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of Kåñëa because they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider Kåñëa an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that Kåñëa is superhuman, that He is sac-cid-änanda-vigraha—the eternal form of bliss and knowledge—that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of Kåñëa’s, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of Kåñëa. Arjuna’s putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider Kåñëa to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature.

Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord Kåñëa spoke the Bhagavad-gétä to the sun-god Vivasvän, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incidence, whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part and parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord.

Kåñëa remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both Kåñëa and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His sac-cid-änanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit—whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And, because the Lord’s body and self are identical, His position is always different from the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform.

If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or Kåñëa. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His prakåti or His form. Prakåti means nature as well as svarüpa, or one’s own form. The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, Kåñëa appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity.

Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence.

Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And, because His appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency—and He is never contaminated by material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His birth in multi-manifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In the Bhägavatam, He appears before His mother as Näräyaëa, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, according to the Viçvakoça dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body.

Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the Bhägavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahmä, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharmaà tu säkñät-bhagavat- praëétam). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad- gétä. The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the Gétä, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and, whenever such principles are disturbed by the demonic, the Lord appears. From the Bhägavatam we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of Kåñëa who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles.

PURPORT According to Bhagavad-gétä, a sädhu (holyman) is a man in Kåñëa consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of Kåñëa consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a sädhu. And duñkåtam applies to one who doesn't care for Kåñëa consciousness. Such miscreants, or duñkåtam, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another person, who is one hundred percent engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, is accepted as sädhu, even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons Rävaëa and Kaàsa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahläda Mahäräja was the son of Hiraëyakaçipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devaké, the mother of Kåñëa, was the sister of Kaàsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because Kåñëa was to be born of them.

Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their individuality. Some of them, who are not situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities.

In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord Kåñëa does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the abovementioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of Kåñëa consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in Kåñëa consciousness, however, is above even the brähmaëas, because a brähmaëa by quality is supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Most of them approach the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord Kåñëa, but only a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a brähmaëa and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Çré Kåñëa, becomes a person in Kåñëa consciousness—or, in other words, a Vaiñëava. Kåñëa consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of Kåñëa, namely Räma, Nåsiàha, Varäha, etc. However, as Kåñëa is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person in Kåñëa consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species.

PURPORT As there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can do no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the activities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions.

In the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate cause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is visible. The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never responsible for their past and present activities. In the Vedänta-sütras it is confirmed that the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity is responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in Kåñëa consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reaction. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in Kåñëa consciousness.

PURPORT There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. Kåñëa consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty things can take to the line of Kåñëa consciousness for a gradual cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same Kåñëa consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby be benefitted. Foolish persons or neophytes in Kåñëa consciousness often want to retire from activities without having knowledge of Kåñëa consciousness. Arjuna’s desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the Lord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the activities of Kåñëa consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of Kåñëa consciousness; is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of Kåñëa. Arjuna is here advised to act in Kåñëa consciousness, following in the footsteps of the Lord’s previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasvän, as mentioned hereinbefore.

Why such action should not be independant will be explained in the text to follow. To act in Kåñëa consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning of this chapter. The system of Kåñëa consciousness was first narrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son Ikñväku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"8c55d6d1-b88f-4ca3-ba45-d425bce60cf7":{"id_":"8c55d6d1-b88f-4ca3-ba45-d425bce60cf7","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3a793497-b02d-4beb-90e1-50f11a42d6ed","metadata":{},"hash":"0DC+ySIXUOMXT2ZN32iGktQE518A2YkkzKYSDoTchjU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"bd2dfd6f-2860-4760-8de4-71eddd36f8be","metadata":{},"hash":"Ps0q2dIM2rVsiloq8TGs/fqyr6kRf7ZwCGbn3mE1lJ4="}},"hash":"xQ+qJnJvtRjH6TfBAnp6DULl1cycqFTlWw2Qy/CLC14=","text":"time. Therefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession. Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of Kåñëa consciousness. For this reason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in Kåñëa consciousness directly. Because of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered. It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect experimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid down by the Lord Himself. Dharmaà hi säkñät-bhagavat-praëétam. No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahmä, Çiva, Närada, Manu, Kumära, Kapila, Prahläda, Bhéñma, Çukadeva Gosvämé, Yamaräja, Janaka, etc. By mental speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization. Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in Kåñëa consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence.

The entire Bhagavad-gétä is directed toward this conclusion. Any other conclusions, against this consciousness and its attendant reactions, are vikarmas, or prohibitive actions. To understand all this one has to associate with authorities in Kåñëa consciousness and learn the secret from them; this is as good as learning from the Lord directly.

He neither begs nor borrows, but he labors honestly as far as is in his power, and is satisfied with whatever is obtained by his own honest labor. He is therefore independant in his livelihood.

However, for the service of the Lord he can participate in any kind of action without being disturbed by the duality of the material world.

PURPORT How activities in Kåñëa consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in Kåñëa consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present, just the principle of Kåñëa consciousness is described. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is Kåñëa consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by Kåñëa consciousness as set forth here in the Gétä. This process is generally known as yajïa, or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Viñëu or Kåñëa. The more the activities of the material world are performed in Kåñëa consciousness, or for Viñëu only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. Brahman means spiritual. The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called brahmajyoti, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that brahmajyoti, but when the jyoti is covered by illusion (mäyä) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by Kåñëa consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of Kåñëa consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution; the process of consumption, the contributor, and the result are—all combined together—Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by mäyä is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. Kåñëa consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme.

Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-éçvara-vädé, or believers in many gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists spend their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman. The Kåñëa conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self—everything—is sacrificed for Kåñëa. Thus, he is the first-class yogé; but he does not lose his individual existence.

PURPORT These sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions. There are persons who are sacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities. In India, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of charitable institutions like dharmaçälä, anna-kñetra, atithi-çälä, anathalaya, vidyäpéöha, etc. In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education and medical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are called dravyamaya-yajïa. There are others who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as candräyana and cäturmäsya. These processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under the cäturmäsya vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day and does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomaya-yajïa. There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas like the Pataïjali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or haöha-yoga or añöäìga-yoga (for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are called yoga-yajïa, sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic literatures, specifically the Upaniñads and Vedänta-sütras, or the säìkhya philosophy. All of these are called svädhyäya-yajïa, or engagement in the sacrifice of studies. All these yogés are faithfully engaged in different types of sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life.

All of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves controlling the air within the body to enable simultaneous passage in opposite directions. The apäna air goes downward, and the präëa air goes up. The präëäyäma yogé practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into püraka, equilibrium. Similarly, when the exhaled breathing is offered to inhaled breathing, it is called recaka. When both air currents are completely stopped, it is called kumbhaka-yoga. By practice of kumbhaka-yoga, the yogés increase the duration of life by many, many years. A Kåñëa conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of Kåñëa, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord Kåñëa; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation. A Kåñëa conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only Kåñëa prasädam, or food which is offered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement.

PURPORT From the foregoing explanation of differents types of sacrifice (namely sacrifice of one’s possessions, study of the Vedas or philosophical doctrines, and performance of the yoga system), it is found that the common aim of all is to control the senses. Sense gratification is the root cause of material existence; therefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from sense gratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal platform of full knowledge, full bliss and full life. This platform is in the eternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By this advancement in life, one not only becomes happy and opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION O best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this planet or in this life: what then of the next? PURPORT Whatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant of his real situation. In other words, existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and sinful life is the cause of one’s dragging on in material existence. The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically solves our economic problems. By performance of yajïa we can have enough food, enough milk, etc.—even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The Vedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yajïa (sacrifice), as described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform yajïa according to the Vedas, how can he expect a happy life? There are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yajïa. But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of Kåñëa consciousness.

Nonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different activities of sacrifice, and one should know this mystery. Sacrifices sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the performer. When one’s faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacrifices should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice material possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge, sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit. Real knowledge culminates in Kåñëa consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental knowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material activities. When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental knowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform. Depending on differences in consciousness, sacrificial activities are sometimes called karma-käëòa, fruitive activities, and sometimes jïäna-käëòa, knowledge in the pursuit of truth. It is better when the end is knowledge.

Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige.

Factually, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of Kåñëa. Kåñëa, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is clearly stated that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of Kåñëa. The Mäyävädé philosophers wrongly think that Kåñëa loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But the Mäyävädé philosophers fail to understand that Absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world. For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from Kåñëa. Although we are separated parts of Kåñëa, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is mäyä, or not actual fact. We are all meant to satisfy Kåñëa.

The whole teaching of the Gétä is targetted toward this end: that a living being, as His eternal servitor, cannot be separated from Kåñëa, and his sense of being an identity apart from Kåñëa is called mäyä.

In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the Gétä is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead, is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in foregoing material possessions, in studying the Vedas, and in partaking of the social institution called varëäçrama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of Bhagavad-gétä, but one who doubts the authority of Kåñëa falls back. One is therefore advised to study Bhagavad-gétä, or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-gétä have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of Bhagavad-gétä as it is expressed in the Gétä itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path.

However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, Kåñëa has perplexed Arjuna and confused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that sannyäsam, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction.

But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than renunciation of works. PURPORT Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. Çrémad-Bhägavatam confirms this as follows: nünaà pramattaù kurute vikarma yad indriya-prétaya äpåëoti na sädhu manye yata ätmano ’yam asann api kleçada äsa dehaù paräbhavas tävad abodha-jäto yävanna jijïäsata ätma-tattvam yävat kriyäs tävad idaà mano vai karmätmakaà yena çaréra-bandhaù evaà manaù karma-vaçaà prayuìkte avidyayätmany upadhéyamäne prétir na yävan mayi väsudeve na mucyate deha-yogena tävat \"People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one’s fruitive activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the nature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to Väsudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence.\" (Bhäg. 5.5.4-6)","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"37384aa3-19ab-44e9-9ab6-604b4ac4680d":{"id_":"37384aa3-19ab-44e9-9ab6-604b4ac4680d","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"6a17dabe-11cb-4a62-aa59-1a0502a54cac","metadata":{},"hash":"7vsq7P03MYLomEHgcEc5vtlUkg8Q1r1ZTgQz8yZhFb0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ea61b90c-1a4f-49ee-ac8e-e1ba68d3b122","metadata":{},"hash":"6odz9DlA5IQkTnqfjLC/RpBD6M0YmU3vX+PFgCM/ehQ="}},"hash":"gjofXpcTYyBmm96R6p/gCV3PIe+/q0X5VngetlnEqE0=","text":"of material existence.\" (Bhäg. 5.5.4-6) Therefore, jïäna (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in Kåñëa consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one’s advancement in real knowledge. Without Kåñëa consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in Kåñëa consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore, action in Kåñëa consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without Kåñëa consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed by Çréla Rüpa Gosvämé in his Bhak ti-rasämåta-sindbu. präpaïcikatayä buddhyä hari-sambandhi-vastunaù mumukñubhiù parityägo vairägyaà phalgu kathyate. \"Renunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, is called incomplete renunciation.\" Renunciation is compete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows that everything is Kåñëa’s property is always situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to Kåñëa, everything should be employed in the service of Kåñëa. This perfect form of action in Kåñëa consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a sannyäsé of the Mäyävädé school.

Consequently, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in some relation with the Supreme. When he acts in Kåñëa consciousness, he is actually in his constitutional position. In the first process of säìkhya, one has to become detached from matter, and in the devotional yoga process one has to attach himself to the work of Kåñëa.

But the Mäyävädé sannyäsés, engaged in the studies of säìkhya and Vedänta and speculation, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bhägavatam without proper understanding. Consequently their study of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam becomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the Mäyävädé sannyäsés. The Vaiñëava sannyäsés, who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God.

Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in Kåñëa consciousness are better situated than the sannyäsés engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although they too come to Kåñëa consciousness, after many births.

PURPORT A person in Kåñëa consciousness is pure in his existence, and consequently he has nothing to do with any work which depends upon five immediate and remote causes: the doer, the work, the situation, the endeavor and fortune. This is because he is engaged in the loving transcendental service of Kåñëa. Although he appears to be acting with his body and senses, he is always conscious of his actual position, which is spiritual engagement. In material consciousness, the senses are engaged in sense gratification, but in Kåñëa consciousness the senses are engaged in the satisfaction of Kåñëa’s senses. Therefore, the Kåñëa conscious person is always free, even though he appears to be engaged in things of the senses. Activities such as seeing, hearing, speaking, evacuating, etc., are actions of the senses meant for work. A Kåñëa consciousness person is never affected by the actions of the senses. He cannot perform any act except in the service of the Lord because he knows that he is the eternal servitor of the Lord.

The person who is attached to Kåñëa and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he is not anxious for fruitive rewards. In the Bhägavatam, the cause of anxiety over the result of an activity is explained as being due to one’s functioning in the conception of duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Kåñëa is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In Kåñëa consciousness, there is no duality. All that exists is a product of Kåñëa’s energy, and Kåñëa is all good. Therefore, activities in Kåñëa consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are transcendental and have no material effect. One is, therefore, filled with peace in Kåñëa consciousness. One who is, however, entangled in profit calculation for sense gratification cannot have that peace. This is the secret of Kåñëa consciousness—realization that there is no existence besides Kåñëa is the platform of peace and fearlessness.

PURPORT The embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates. The activities of the body, or the figurative city of body, are conducted automatically by the particular modes of nature. The soul, although subjecting himself to the conditions of the body, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires. Owing only to forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and therefore suffers. By Kåñëa consciousness, he can revive his real position and thus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, when one takes to Kåñëa consciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities. In such a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily within the city of nine gates. The nine gates are described as follows: nava-dväre pure dehé haàso leläyate bahiù vaçé sarvasya lokasya sthävarasya carasya ca. \"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is living within the body of a living entity, is the controller of all living entities all over the universe.

He is always satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living entity is not.

The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as Paramätmä, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of conditioning of the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independant living entities.

After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto Kåñëa, or when one attains Kåñëa consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals everything in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he thinks himself God, unceremoniously, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect Kåñëa consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what Kåñëa consciousness is. The spiritual master can drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide Kåñëa conscious spiritual master.

A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God.

He is therefore not joyful in achieving something, nor does he lament in losing anything which is related to his body. This steadiness of mind is called sthira-buddhi, or self-intelligence. He is therefore never bewildered by mistaking the gross body for the soul, nor does he accept the body as permanent and disregard the existence of the soul. This knowledge elevates him to the station of knowing the complete science of the Absolute Truth, namely Brahman, Paramätmä and Bhagavän. He thus knows his constitutional position perfectly well, without falsely trying to become one with the Supreme in all respects. This is called Brahman realization, or self-realization. Such steady consciousness is called Kåñëa consciousness.

A person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of human society cannot factually help anyone. Temporary relief of the external body and the mind is not satisfactory. The real cause of one’s difficulties in the hard struggle for life may be found in one’s forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord.

PURPORT Being engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, one can immediately understand one’s spiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by means of devotional service. When he is well situated in devotional service, one comes to the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the Lord in the sphere of one’s activity. This particular position is called liberation in the Supreme. After explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the practice of mysticism or yoga, known as añöäìga-yoga, which is divisible into an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, äsana, präëäyäma, pratyähära, dhäraëä, dhyäna, and samädhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell by the pratyähära (breathing) process in yoga, and then keep the vision of the eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half closed lids. There is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening the eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense objects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by neutralizing the up- and down-moving air within the body.

Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature.

The question of mental speculation as to how karma- yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in Kåñëa consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct Kåñëa consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and jïäna-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. Kåñëa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one’s relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of Kåñëa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with mäyä (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over mäyä, and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities.

Everything depends on one’s practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And, attaining Kåñëa consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahman-nirväëa. The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in Kåñëa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama, äsana, pratyähära, dhyäna, dhäraëä, präëäyäma, and samädhi.

TRANSLATION The Blessed Lord said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic: not he who lights no fire and performs no work. PURPORT In this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga system is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the age of Kali. Although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process of karma-yoga, or acting in Kåñëa consciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in Kåñëa consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in Kåñëa consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sannyäsé, the perfect yogé. The sannyäsés sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yajïas (fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is becoming one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yogé who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"49604565-d43f-40c8-ad40-84693b695051":{"id_":"49604565-d43f-40c8-ad40-84693b695051","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b907ad37-b2da-447a-97f7-f2356ce99262","metadata":{},"hash":"RcjJeCZCdzEQbSxZXmFO3Cc/eeReeVI8kSukUhIUH4w="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"6bd72a4f-6568-41d2-ad72-e1a6cfd4edc5","metadata":{},"hash":"2KTHPlpJngPF4f2hm53SJDpa35VZX1HF7RgCSKHRpP8="}},"hash":"vNayimvuMKkUD2mBvBGVNViQODvyGKXPnwRlvupVXDY=","text":"activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self.

The living entity has no separate independent identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is Kåñëa conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the yogés who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in Kåñëa consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of Kåñëa. Therefore, a Kåñëa conscious person is simultaneously a sannyäsé and a yogé. The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the jïäna and yoga processes, is automatically served in Kåñëa consciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, then jïäna and yoga are of no avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A Kåñëa conscious person has no desire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self-satisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All these purposes are perfectly served by the practice of Kåñëa consciousness.

TRANSLATION For one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be the means; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all material activities is said to be the means. PURPORT The process of linking oneself with the Supreme is called yoga, which may be compared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization. This ladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises up to perfect self-realization in pure spiritual life. According to various elevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names. But all in all, the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided into three parts, namely jïäna-yoga, dhyäna-yoga and bhakti-yoga. The beginning of the ladder is called the yogärurukña stage, and the highest rung is called yogärüòha. Concerning the eightfold yoga system, attempts in the beginning to enter into meditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different sitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered fruitive material activities. All such activities lead to achieving perfect mental equilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the practice of meditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities. A Kåñëa conscious person is, however, situated from the beginning on the platform of meditation because he always thinks of Kåñëa. And, being constantly engaged in the service of Kåñëa, he is considered to have ceased all material activities.

Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense gratification, since one cannot live without engagement. Without Kåñëa consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish activities. But a Kåñëa conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction of Kåñëa and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification. One who has no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder.

PURPORT The word ätmä denotes body, mind and soul—depending upon different circumstances. In the yoga system, the mind and the conditioned soul are especially important. Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice, ätmä refers here to the mind. The purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because of the mind’s ego which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in Kåñëa consciousness. The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that one must do this. It is also said: mana eva manuñyäëäà käraëaà bandha-mokñayoù bandhäya viñayäsaìgo muktyai nirviñayaà manaù. \"For man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation.

Unless the mind is controlled, the practice of yoga (for show) is simply a waste of time. One who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission are spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior. As long as one’s mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as Paramätmä.

Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on Kåñëa. One should always think of Kåñëa and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called samädhi or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects.

And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.

The seat should neither be too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place. The yogé should then sit on it very firmly and should practice yoga by controlling the mind and the senses, purifying the heart and fixing the mind on one point. PURPORT \"Sacred place\" refers to places of pilgrimage. In India the yogés, the transcendentalists or the devotees all leave home and reside in sacred places such as Prayäg, Mathurä, Våndävana, Håñékeça, and Hardwar and in solitude practice yoga where the sacred rivers like the Yamunä and the Ganges flow. But often this is not possible, especially for Westerners. The so-called yoga societies in big cities may be successful in earning material benefit, but they are not at all suitable for the actual practice of yoga. One who is not self- controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation. Therefore, in the Båhan-Näradéya Puräëa it is said that in the Kali-yuga (the present yuga or age) when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual realization and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord. harer näma harer näma harer nämaiva kevalam kalau nästy eva nästy eva nästy eva gatir anyathä. \"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord.

PURPORT The goal of life is to know Kåñëa, who is situated within the heart of every living being as Paramätmä, the four-handed Viñëu form. The yoga process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of Viñëu, and not for any other purpose. The localized Viñëu-mürti is the plenary representation of Kåñëa dwelling within one’s heart. One who has no program to realize this Viñëu-murti is uselessly engaged in mock-yoga practice and is certainly wasting his time. Kåñëä is the ultimate goal of life, and the Viñëu-murti situated in one’s heart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this Viñëu-murti within the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called yoga class and thus become a yogé. One has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yäjïavalkya it is said: karmaëä manasä väcä sarvävasthäsu sarvadä sarvatra maithuëa-tyägo brahmacaryaà pracakñate. \"The vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work, words and mind—at all times, under all circumstances, and in all places.\" No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence. Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood when one has no knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmacärés. Without such practice, no one can make advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhyäna, jïäna or bhakti.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"2d85b41a-4798-413b-8534-a9d9d7a09cd2":{"id_":"2d85b41a-4798-413b-8534-a9d9d7a09cd2","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"80a7a1a5-c789-43b2-95c5-d52a1eb9989e","metadata":{},"hash":"wOWWCLm3hphL6i8q8Zv1jpmZqlgkP/OivEXhbvjLhRc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7bee44eb-a406-495a-988e-91bdd99aecfe","metadata":{},"hash":"izIm8kzbawSGc1hWhP5ngUmbAY9V0yypA/rvW+B0l90="}},"hash":"XMMXa8Qyh4PNN3uqj2c1LVew0OWQFyiqMaZU7DWiF/Y=","text":"One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called brahmacäré. Such a restrained householder brahmacäré may be accepted in the bhakti school, but the jïäna and dhyäna schools do not admit even householder brahmacärés. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti school, a householder brahmacäré is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gétä it is said: viñayä vinivartante nirähärasya dehinaù rasa-varjaà raso ’py asya paraà dåñövä nivartate Whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste. Vigatabhéù. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in Kåñëa consciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Kåñëa. The Bhägavatam says, bhayaà dvitéyäbhiniveçataù syäd éçäd apetasya viparyayo ‘småtiù: Kåñëa consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a person who is Kåñëa conscious. And since the ultimate goal of yoga practice is to see the Lord within, a Kåñëa conscious person is already the best of all yogés.

All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self- illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called paraà dhäma, or superior abodes.

Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of fasting, practice yoga. The Kåñëa conscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required, and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice. One who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance.

Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed activities are called arcanä, or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord. The senses and the mind require engagements. Simple abnegation is not practical. Therefore, for people in general—especially those who are not in the renounced order of life—transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called yukta in the Bhagavad-gétä.

And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or samädhi which means that the yogé realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the Pataïjali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Pataïjali system of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Pataïjali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure—realized through transcendental senses— is accepted. And this is corroborated by the Pataïjali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his Yoga-sütras: puruñärtha-çünyänäà guëänäà pratiprasavaù kaivalyaà svarüpa-pratiñöhä vä citi-çaktir iti. This citi-çakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puruñärtha means material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This \"oneness with the Supreme\" is called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Pataïjali, this kaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called ceto-darpaëa-märjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This \"clearance\" is actually liberation, or bhava- mahädävägni-nirväpaëam.

In the Bhägavatam this is called svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù. The Bhagavad-gétä also confirms this situation in this verse. After nirväëa, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as Kåñëa consciousness. In the words of the Bhägavatam, svarüpeëa vyavasthitiù: this is the \"real life of the living entity.\" Mäyä, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Pataïjali also accepts this by his words kaivalyam svarüpa-pratiñöhä vä citi-çaktir iti. This citi- çakti or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the Vedänta- sütras as änandamayo ’bhyäsät. This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiyoga will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of samädhi, called samprajïäta-samädhi and asamprajïäta-samädhi. When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, it is called samprajïäta-samädhi. In the asamprajïäta-samädhi there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yogé is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yogé is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today’s so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yogé indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"8167faa7-28a4-401b-8589-4b5305059e4d":{"id_":"8167faa7-28a4-401b-8589-4b5305059e4d","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d8e1ee95-8d06-4b45-853e-22d96b08e5e3","metadata":{},"hash":"lBRNPgos+MpfgA3k6VAEgFykOkKOfCUqOsnHYFHGH2E="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ca276e3f-8509-4671-9df5-b00a688180ec","metadata":{},"hash":"2mXFGV1iEtSoxQld5mDUX5eD+2ukBIvmCJojYaAerTI="}},"hash":"hva04f4KPAUrjEhMYuon/xgVJYdD2Ri3B+YBPjlew/w=","text":"A yogé indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yogés who are attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated. If the yogés are attracted by the by-products of yoga, then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way. The best practice of yoga in this age is Kåñëa consciousness, which is not baffling. A Kåñëa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing haöha-yoga, dhyäna-yoga, and jïäna-yoga, but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga. As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure bhakti-yoga or in Kåñëa consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in Kåñëa consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences―such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative―but he is always alert to execute his duties in Kåñëa consciousness or bhakti-yoga. Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, ägamäpäyino ’nityäs täàs titikñasva bhärata. He endures all such incidental occurences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice.

The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garuòa, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Viñëu, heard it. He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garuòa was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus Garuòa at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garuòa. Similarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti-yoga in Kåñëa consciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the principles with great determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help themselves.

Kåñëa consciousness is the development of love of Kåñëa―a position transcendental even to material liberation. It is the stage beyond self- realization at which the devotee becomes one with Kåñëa in the sense that Kåñëa becomes everything for the devotee, and the devotee becomes full in loving Kåñëa. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In that stage, the living entity attains his immortality. Nor is the Personality of Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in Kåñëa is spiritual annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the Brahma-saàhitä: premäïjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaù sadaiva hådayeñu vilokayanti yaà çyämasundaram acintya-guëa-svarüpaà govindam ädi-puruñaà tam ahaà bhajämi “I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love.

In the case of a yogé who sees the Lord as Paramätmä within the heart, the same applies. Such a yogé turns into a pure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment with out seeing the Lord within himself.

Such a strong mind is supposed to be controlled by the practice of yoga, but such practice is never practical for a worldly person like Arjuna. And what can we say of modern man? The simile used here is appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind. And it is even more difficult to capture the turbulent mind. The easiest way to control the mind, as suggested by Lord Caitanya, is chanting \"Hare Kåñëa,\" the great mantra for deliverance, in all humility. The method prescribed is sa vai manaù kåñëa-padäravindayoù: one must engage one’s mind fully in Kåñëa. Only then will there remain no other engagements to agitate the mind.

But at the same time He suggests that by practice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present age no one can observe strict rules and regulations, such as placing oneself in a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of Kåñëa consciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the Lord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about Kåñëa. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings. The more one hears about Kåñëa, the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from Kåñëa. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn vairägya. Vairägya means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of Kåñëa. This is practical because by hearing about Kåñëa one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment is called pareçänubhüti spiritual satisfaction.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"7e281305-8616-4d49-b4d3-4c4ad380a427":{"id_":"7e281305-8616-4d49-b4d3-4c4ad380a427","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"84e679bf-3375-4880-8d21-d565668fbe31","metadata":{},"hash":"xd5CgPgjV++sPipc0FW0PTmeXXZjBxVhlIjho394vYA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7f624629-eeed-4025-9173-1362cdd7711d","metadata":{},"hash":"rkwkXRiOXroIkaiK35PmhC8+F1PxikeaZhNlKdJCdiU="}},"hash":"fa5/7Q1jCCpsxzEVKKs/KdTurPpgh8E7c7j2sgzdB6I=","text":"Supreme Spirit.

Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, the practice of the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga. In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking Lord Kåñëa to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor, one may fail for many reasons. First of all, one may not be following the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called yogät calita-mänasaù: deviation from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization.

So He has already cleared up the question of the future of the individual living entity. Now, Arjuna wants to know of the future of the unsuccessful transcendentalist.

A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, Kåñëa consciousness. One may argue that by Kåñëa consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction of not executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bhägavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he may be subjected to the reaction of not perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious Kåñëa consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in Kåñëa consciousness. The purport may be understood as follows: humanity may be divided into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities. Their activities are never auspicious because, enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material existence, which is always miserable.

The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in Kåñëa consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of Kåñëa consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity.

The yogé who falls after a short period of practice goes to the higher planets where pious living entities are allowed to enter. After prolonged life there, he is sent back again to this planet, to take birth in the family of a righteous brähmaëa vaiñëava or of aristocratic merchants. The real purpose of yoga practice is to achieve the highest perfection of Kåñëa consciousness. But those who do not persevere to such an extent and fail due to material allurements are allowed, by the grace of the Lord, to make full utilization of their material propensities. And after that, they are given opportunities to live prosperous lives in righteous or aristocratic families. Those who are born in such families may take advantage of the facilities and try to elevate themselves to full Kåñëa consciousness.

It is especially the case in the äcärya or gosvämé families. Such families are very learned and devoted by tradition and training, and thus they become spiritual masters. In India there are many such äcärya families, but they have now degenerated due to insufficient education and training. By the grace of the Lord, there are still families that foster transcendentalists generation after generation. It is certainly very fortunate to take birth in such families.

King Bharata was the Emperor of the world, and since his time this planet is known among the demigods as Bhäratavarña. Formerly it was known as Ilävartavarña. The Emperor, at an early age, retired for spiritual perfection but failed to achieve success. In his next life he took birth in the family of a good brähmaëa and was known as Jaòabharata because he always remained secluded and did not talk to anyone. And later on, he was discovered as the greatest transcendentalist by King Rahügaëa. From his life it is understood that transcendental endeavors, or the practice of yoga, never go in vain. By the grace of the Lord the transcendentalist gets repeated opportunities for complete perfection in Kåñëa consciousness.

PURPORT In this Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä, the nature of Kåñëa consciousness is fully described. Kåñëa is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to Kåñëa, and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to Kåñëa are described in this chapter. In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä, the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul which is capable of elevating himself to self- realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon Kåñëa, or in other words Kåñëa consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga. By concentrating one’s mind upon Kåñëa, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise.

In complete Kåñëa consciousness one knows that Kåñëa is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of yoga are only steppingstones on the path of Kåñëa consciousness. One who takes directly to Kåñëa consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti and Paramätmä in full. By practice of Kåñëa consciousness yoga, one can know everything in full―namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia. One should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon Kåñëa the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which çravaëam is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, \"tat çåëu,\" or \"Hear from Me.\" No one can be a greater authority than Kåñëa, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity for progress in Kåñëa consciousness. One has therefore to learn from Kåñëa directly or from a pure devotee of Kåñëa―and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam this process of understanding Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows: çåëvatäà sva-kathäà kåñëaù puëya-çravaëa-kértanaù hådyantaùstho hy abhadräëi vidbunoti suhåt satäm. nañöa-präyeñv abhadreñu nityaà bhägavata-sevayä bhagavaty uttama-çloke bhaktir bhavati naiñöhiké. tadä rajas-tamo-bhäväù käma-lobhadayaç ca ye","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"ef85ea2c-ac65-454f-810b-370f319dbe8a":{"id_":"ef85ea2c-ac65-454f-810b-370f319dbe8a","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4d0a7301-d1cf-4c74-a0a1-df9f9da5eac4","metadata":{},"hash":"3/SVauhF4HR/Ehvxy5vY3z1XHRfUOK0aAuKTNWyaqXU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c6c3c714-e38c-4e76-9205-8fd03528910f","metadata":{},"hash":"+B5iGH3sShAD46m5tl96q5vyWsqG+PuG1AtR+Sn2/j0="}},"hash":"G/DprFLHG/igPzZXvOEqfkoy0K667Vy1vmiC7MCzaDo=","text":"ceta etair anäviddhaà sthitaà sattve prasédati. evam prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataù bhagavat-tattva-vijïänaà mukta-saìgasya jäyate. bhidyate hådaya-granthiç chidyante sarva-saàçayäù kñéyante cäsya karmäëi dåñöa evätmanéçvare. \"To hear about Kåñëa from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the Bhagavad-gétä, is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about Kåñëa, Lord Kåñëa, who is dwelling in everyone’s heart, acts as a best- wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about Kåñëa from the Bhägavatam and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of ‘asaàçayaà samagram,’ understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead.\" (Bhäg. 1.2.17–21) Therefore only by hearing from Kåñëa or from His devotee in Kåñëa consciousness can one understand the science of Kåñëa.

The Lord wants to explain the above-mentioned system of knowledge because Arjuna is Kåñëa’s confidential devotee and friend. In the beginning of the Fourth Chapter this explanation was given by the Lord, and it is again confirmed here: complete knowledge can be achieved only by the devotee of the Lord directly from the Lord in disciplic succession. Therefore one should be intelligent enough to know the source of all knowledge, who is the cause of all causes and the only object for meditation in all types of yoga practices. When the cause of all causes becomes known, then everything knowable becomes known, and nothing remains unknown.

Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The first six chapters of the Gétä are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by jïäna-yoga, dhyäna-yoga, and discrimination of the self from matter. However, Kåñëa can only be known by persons who are in Kåñëa consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding Kåñëa. Kåñëa is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Paramätmä. The yogés and jïänés are confused in their attempts to understand Kåñëa, although the greatest of the impersonalists, Çrépäda Çaìkaräcärya, has admitted in his Gétä commentary that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But his followers do not accept Kåñëa as such, for it is very difficult to know Kåñëa, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"ef4979c9-2017-48a5-9ba2-25b2cec8f432":{"id_":"ef4979c9-2017-48a5-9ba2-25b2cec8f432","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ce94f514-d9ee-4c4d-bb82-75f517b4e243","metadata":{},"hash":"0ynnM854IYJe46dO9TvdwQOil7hO1Wx2yggOx98oF8M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b0d0ad39-70d1-40ff-9df0-6f24bebf4874","metadata":{},"hash":"UTyLAhxVUFaonZrqV2pPy6d6nwx1XkV32WlRPlqzayM="}},"hash":"dl9zyGokvODG3cIR0EvhVPa1OH31FOPS4NW0TRlCz8k=","text":"of impersonal Brahman.

Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about Kåñëa: “muhyanti yat sürayaù,” “mäà tu veda na kaçcana.” “No one knows Me as I am,” the Lord says.

Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa. He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies. In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above mentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, within which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, Kåñëa. The false ego―\"I am,\" and \"It is mine,\" which constitute the basic principle of material existence―includes ten sense organs for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the subject matter of säìkhya atheistic philosophy; they are originally offshoots from Kåñëa’s energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic säìkhya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know Kåñëa as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the säìkhya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of Kåñëa, as it is described in the Bhagavad-gétä.

The inferior energy is matter manifested in different elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego.

The living entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the entire material world functions.

They are never equally powerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the living entities and the Lord is described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam as follows (10.87.30): aparimitä dhruväs tanubhåto yadi sarva-gatäs tarhià na çäsyateti niyamo dhruva netarathä","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"f14f517f-af3e-492f-9e74-b8785305b164":{"id_":"f14f517f-af3e-492f-9e74-b8785305b164","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7c8d355b-95c9-45be-a406-fc0051691d83","metadata":{},"hash":"GRDgs/YD2Vv/mrhwgdwLOnfbsjb2t8gwhD8jRv65D6k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"978242ea-7557-4b93-ba36-1823d4fc6a72","metadata":{},"hash":"5jO7vfMD5c8OOsSnsxF850NMZTk1TRtilo+N1KAczFA="}},"hash":"q30GZnaiH7gK6DfGWXjniq3ygJN4b7KPs6MCWzjxaQM=","text":"tarhià na çäsyateti niyamo dhruva netarathä ajani ca yanmayaà tad avimucya niyantå bhavet samam anujänatäà yad-amataà mata-duñöatayä \"O Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and all- pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the living entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are at once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation entails surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make them happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers. Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that God and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually misleading themselves and others.\" The Supreme Lord Kåñëa is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the influence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage called mukti, or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material illusion, thinks, \"I am matter, and material acquisitions are mine.\" His actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may conclude that the Gétä confirms the living entity to be only one of the multi- energies of Kåñëa; and when this energy is freed from material contamination, it becomes fully Kåñëa conscious, or liberated.

PURPORT Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is the basic field of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a certain stage of material development. Rather, this material world is manifested only on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is developed because spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to manhood because of that superior energy, spirit soul, being present. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of the presence of the Supersoul, Viñëu. Therefore spirit and matter, which combine together to manifest this gigantic universal form, are originally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original cause of everything. A fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely, the living entity, may by manipulation of material energy construct a skyscraper, factory or city, but he cannot create matter out of nothing, and he certainly cannot construct a planet or a universe. The cause of the universe is the Supersoul, Kåñëa, the supreme creator of all individual souls and the original cause of all causes, as the Kaöha Upaniñad confirms: nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm.

PURPORT There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is personal or impersonal. As far as Bhagavad-gétä is concerned, the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa, and this is confirmed in every step. In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the Brahma-saàhitä: éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù sac-cid- änanda-vigrahaù; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord Kåñëa, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes.

But beyond Brahmä there is the Transcendence who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations.

But this arüpam is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the Brahma-saàhitä quoted above. Other verses in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad substantiate this as follows: vedäham etaà puruñaà mahäntam äditya-varëaà tamasaù parastät tam eva vidvän amåta iha bhavati nänyaù panthä vidyate ayanäya yasmät paraà näparam asti kiïcid yasmännäëéyo na jyäyo ’sti kiïcit \"I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all material conceptions of darkness.

He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest. He is situated as a silent tree, and He illumines the transcendental sky, and as a tree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies.\" From these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is all-pervading by His multi-energies, both material and spiritual.

PURPORT This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material and spiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, similarly, the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading, diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of water. No one likes to drink sea water because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying water to quench man’s thirst. That is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no conflict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"881a7be3-2ef5-4992-9777-10e9ee90a84c":{"id_":"881a7be3-2ef5-4992-9777-10e9ee90a84c","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1b45253c-0929-4991-a0d0-9986f6ca03c5","metadata":{},"hash":"ixF5pEsNIDMPQolvi3iJ1EDVIiPn+/lal7NVLi7kUws="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cd50b273-cb9c-42d8-9b0c-ffa95804445a","metadata":{},"hash":"kvY15kSW6Xo3Vq08F787ZzvgCckPchNWpxdcbrJYsZo="}},"hash":"yrpas34srTU7HWGEpoIOmv2WYw0yhFxtmP5Iqhr2VvE=","text":"impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction.

Similarly, everything has a particular original taste, and this taste can be changed by the mixture of chemicals. So everything original has some smell, some fragrance, and some taste. Vibhäva means fire. Without fire we cannot run factories, we cannot cook, etc., and that fire is Kåñëa. The heat in the fire is Kåñëa. According to Vedic medicine, indigestion is due to a low temperature in the belly. So even for digestion fire is needed. In Kåñëa consciousness we become aware that earth, water, fire, air and every active principle, all chemicals and all material elements are due to Kåñëa. The duration of man’s life is also due to Kåñëa. Therefore by the grace of Kåñëa, man can prolong his life or diminish it. So Kåñëa consciousness is active in every sphere.

PURPORT Béjam means seed; Kåñëa is the seed of everything. In contact with material nature, the seed fructifies into various living entities, movable and inert. Birds, beasts, men and many other living creatures are moving living entities; trees and plants, however, are inert—they cannot move, but only stand. Every entity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000 species of life; some of them are moving and some of them are inert. In all cases, however, the seed of their life is Kåñëa. As stated in Vedic literature, Brahman, or the Supreme Absolute Truth, is that from which everything is emanating. Kåñëa is Parabrahman, the Supreme Spirit. Brahman is impersonal and Parabrahman is personal. Impersonal Brahman is situated in the personal aspect—that is stated in Bhagavad-gétä. Therefore, originally, Kåñëa is the source of everything. He is the root. As the root of a tree maintains the whole tree, Kåñëa, being the original root of all things, maintains everything in this material manifestation. This is also confirmed in the Vedic literature. Yato vä imäni bhütäni jäyante. \"The Supreme Absolute Truth is that from which everything is born.\" He is the prime eternal among all eternals. He is the supreme living entity of all living entities, and He alone is maintaining all life. Kåñëa also says that He is the root of all intelligence. Unless a person is intelligent he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.

No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation.

A man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himself—he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord Kåñëa, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or Kåñëa consciousness, can help one gain such release. Kåñëa, being the Lord of illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity who is originally a beloved son of the Lord.

PURPORT It is said in Bhagavad-gétä that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality Kåñëa, one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature.

But because the atheist’s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called duñkåtina, which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected. In the Gétä it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hiraëyakaçipu and Rävaëa, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These duñkåtinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below: (1) The müòhas are those who are grossly foolish, like hard-working beasts of burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying only disturbs others. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work. He does not know that karma (action) is meant for yajïa (sacrifice). Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"43d35bc6-d9ae-4dfe-a127-94088553848e":{"id_":"43d35bc6-d9ae-4dfe-a127-94088553848e","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ea58629f-c334-4bfc-a8ad-9c673fea009c","metadata":{},"hash":"e3cjh/BKXZph2U7KGf2jIR4ovtPKYZfXj9OTCyeKnMI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ccfd345c-bc5e-44b8-99f2-beb066138eff","metadata":{},"hash":"gFwCbZ37VU7ttz6I2U02suKukFTPjKxUahxuwi/XAvA="}},"hash":"1kUpKHJ9h2uRXPZ+8pDeVgDwiXbJ2MgBZRfirNKf0Ag=","text":"living being. To such müòhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life’s all in all―despite the fact that the müòhas enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane force that moves the material world. (2) Another class of duñkåtina, or miscreant, is called the narädhama, or the lowest of mankind. Nara means human being, and adhama means the lowest. Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulated principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and politically developed, but who have no religious principles, must be considered narädhamas. Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man’s relation with Him. In the Gétä the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of human life is meant for man’s reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead Çré Kåñëa, who is all-powerful.

We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother’s womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by mäyä, the illusory energy. It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the Manu-småti, which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving God consciousness in the system of varëäçrama. However, no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the population is narädhama. When the whole population becomes narädhama, naturally all their so-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature. According to the standard of the Gétä, a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned brähmaëa, the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. Çré Nityänanda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical narädhamas, the brothers Jagai and Madhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the narädhama who is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu, in propagating the bhägavata-dharma or activities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the Personality of Godhead.

He is mentioned as the father of Brahmä, the original father of all human beings. In fact, Çré Kåñëa is said to be not only the father of Brahmä but also the father of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Paramätmä; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, the mäyayäpahåta-jïäna deride the Personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord. All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gétä by the class of mäyayäpahåta- jïäna, outside the purview of the paramparä system, are so many stumbling blocks in the path of spiritual understanding.

These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure devotees because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit.

Those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal Brahman and the localized Paramätmä and come to the personal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and they search after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.

It is said in the Bhägavatam that less intelligent people who have lost their spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in particular modes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship various demigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they are satisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord Kåñëa is the master of all. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is said that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is master and all others are servants. Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of his material needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee is satisfied with whatever He gives.

As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full independence—whatever one likes—but His ultimate instruction we find in the Bhagavad-gétä: man should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy. Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without the supreme will.

In this way there are recommendations in the çästras (Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is the Supreme Lord or the Supersoul who is present in the heart of all living entities, Kåñëa gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence.

TRANSLATION Endowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and obtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone. PURPORT The demigods cannot award benediction to the devotees without the permission of the Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget that everything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired results are not due to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the Supreme Lord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired by the living entity, and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. In the Caitanya-caritämåta it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires. Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual.

Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food. This isn't very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord. Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities are also. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that the brähmaëas are the head of the Supreme Lord, the kñatriyas are the arms, etc., and that all serve different functions. Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he does not understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigods reside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches. The results achieved by the demigods’ benedictions are perishable because within this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee engaged in Kåñëa consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Therefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.

Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Vedänta and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true Kåñëa consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God’s personal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as asuras, which means one who does not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul―but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor, Çaìkaräcärya, who has specifically stated that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Kåñëa to be only the son of Devaké and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This is also condemned in Bhagavad-gétä: \"Only the fools regard Me as an ordinary person.\" The fact is that no one can understand Kåñëa without rendering devotional service and without developing Kåñëa consciousness. The Gétä confirms this. One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, or His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature.

It is also stated that the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord Kåñëa go to the Kåñëaloka planet.

In the transcendental association of Kåñëa consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a Kåñëa conscious person can never forget Kåñëa. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Våndävana. This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully Kåñëa conscious person. The beginning of Kåñëa consciousness is association of persons who are Kåñëa conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand Kåñëa to be the Supreme God. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets Kåñëa and becomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of Kåñëa consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of Kåñëa he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain Kåñëa consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord. Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of Paramätmä, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord.

The Çrémad-Bhägavatam explains that the Supreme Absolute Truth is known as Brahman, Paramätmä, and Bhagavän. In addition, the living entity, individual soul, is also called Brahman. Arjuna also inquires about ätmä, which refers to body, soul and mind. According to the Vedic dictionary, ätmä refers to the mind, soul, body and senses also. Arjuna has addressed the Supreme Lord as Puruñottama, Supreme Person, which means that he was putting these questions not simply to a friend but to the Supreme Person, knowing Him to be the supreme authority able to give definitive answers.

PURPORT The Lord of sacrifice accepts Indra and Viñëu. Viñëu is the chief of the primal demigods, including Brahmä and Çiva, and Indra is the chief of the administrative demigods. Both Indra and Viñëu are worshiped by yajïa performances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yajïa (sacrifice), and how is the Lord residing within the body of the living entity. Arjuna addresses the Lord as Madhusüdana because Kåñëa once killed a demon named Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna because Arjuna is a Kåñëa conscious devotee. Therefore these doubts are like demons. Since Kåñëa is so expert in killing demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhusüdana so that Kåñëa might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna’s mind. Now the word prayäëa-käle in this verse is very significant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna fears that at the time of death, those who are in Kåñëa consciousness will forget the Supreme Lord because at such a time body functions are disrupted and the mind may be in a panic-stricken state. Therefore Mahäräja Kulaçekhara, a great devotee, prays, “My dear Lord, may I die immediately now that I’m healthy so that the swan of my mind may enter into the stem of Thy lotus feet.” This metaphor is used because the swan often takes pleasure in entering the stem of the lotus flower- similarly, the mind of the pure devotee is drawn to the lotus feet of the Lord. Mahäräja Kulaçekhara fears that at the moment of death his throat will be so choked up that he will not be able to chant the holy names, so it is better to “die immediately.” Arjuna questions how one’s mind can remain fixed on Kåñëa’s lotus feet at such times.

In material consciousness, his nature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual (Kåñëa) consciousness, his position is to serve the Supreme.

The living entity (jévätmä) takes different positions―sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord’s marginal energy. According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In material nature he is sometimes manifested as a man, demigod, an animal, a beast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yajïa), but when his merit is exhausted, he returns to earth again in the form of a man. ln the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the merit of sacrifice is exhausted, then the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path. The Kåñëa conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He takes directly to Kåñëa consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to Godhead. Impersonalist commentators on the Gétä unreasonably assume that Brahman takes the form of jéva in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the Gétä. But this verse also speaks of the living entity as “an eternal fragment of Myself.” The fragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down.

The universe is the cosmic form of the Supreme Lord, and I am that Lord represented as the Supersoul, dwelling in the heart of every embodied being. PURPORT The physical nature is constantly changing. Material bodies generally pass through six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration, they produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish. This physical nature is called adhibhütam. Because it is created at a certain point and will be annihilated at a certain point, the conception of the universal form of the Supreme Lord that includes all the demigods and their different planets is called adhidaivatam.

First of all, He is puruña, spiritual, Räma and Kåñëa, and is described herein as kavim; that is, He knows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, maintainer and instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one 10,000th part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya (inconceivable) is very significant in this connection. God’s energy is beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable (acintya).

PURPORT Lord Kåñëa explains that Brahman, although one without a second, has different manifestations and features. For the impersonalists, the syllable om is identical with Brahman. Kåñëa here explains the impersonal Brahman in which the renounced order of sages enter. In the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught to vibrate om and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman’s features. This practice is very essential for the student’s advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such brahmacäré (unmarried celibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of one’s practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the brahmacäré principles. Unless one practices celibacy, advancement in spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this age of Kali, that no process of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy name of Lord Kåñëa: Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare, Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare.

TRANSLATION The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga. PURPORT To practice yoga, as suggested here, one first has to close the door of all sense enjoyment. This practice is called pratyähära, or withdrawing the senses from the sense objects. Sense organs for acquiring knowledge, such as the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch, should be fully controlled and should not be allowed to engage in self-gratification. In this way the mind focuses on the Supersoul in the heart and the life force is raised to the top of the head. In the Sixth Chapter this process is described in detail. But as mentioned before, this practice is not practical in this age. The best process is Kåñëa consciousness. If one is always able to fix his mind on Kåñëa in devotional service, it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental trance, or in samädhi.

Similarly, those who are devotees of Kåñëa enter the Kåñëa planet or Goloka Våndävana, whereas the impersonalists remain in the brahmajyoti. The personalists also enter many innumerable planets in the spiritual sky known as Vaikuëöhas.

PURPORT ln this verse the bhakti-yoga of the unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Godhead is described. The preceeding verses mention four different kinds of devotees—the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation from material entanglement have also been described: karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, and haöha- yoga. But here bhakti-yoga, without any mixture of these, is mentioned. In bhakti-yoga the devotees desire nothing but Kåñëa. The pure bhakti devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the Caitanya-caritämåta the pure devotee is called niñkäma, which means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. The pure devotee only wants to please the Supreme Lord, and so the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain. The devotee can render service to any of the transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord, and he meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other yogas. Bhakti- yoga is very simple and pure and easy to perform. One can begin by simply chanting Hare Kåñëa. Kåñëa is very merciful to those who engage in His service, and He helps in various ways that devotee who is fully surrendered to Him so he can understand Him as He is. The Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"674a1bd6-282c-4908-b5a0-601fa543bbe1":{"id_":"674a1bd6-282c-4908-b5a0-601fa543bbe1","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"14023cfc-ecf6-4b41-8492-dc9b8bb22374","metadata":{},"hash":"Cm6KpsqxfM0mmX5+JaEvehzM8nF8WuKZqwCjFGt9Hc0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"083abd86-af24-45b7-805f-2b0715e64a44","metadata":{},"hash":"EnD4xOvU/4TuLMv7ElT4OWUpFiifySbt5V6RowVnP4E="}},"hash":"mph/aTcNIv45R8qReaL/dpW7tTzfjP9C3vMgwTvPU7E=","text":"sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom. The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of Kåñëa without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like Våndävana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of Våndävana by his devotional service. It was Çré Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, “Wherever You are, O Lord―there is Våndavana.” A pure devotee constantly remembers Kåñëa and meditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom the Lord is most easily attainable. Bhakti-yoga is the system that the Gétä recommends above all others. Generally, the bhakti-yogés are engaged in five different ways: 1) çänta- bhakta, engaged in devotional service in neutrality; 2) däsya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; 3) säkhya-bhakta, engaged as friend; 4) vätsalya-bhakta, engaged as parent; and 5) mädhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly, the Supreme Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the Kåñëa conscious process of chanting the mahämantra, Hare Kåñëa.

The supreme planet is described in Vedic literature as beyond our material vision, and it is considered the highest goal. The mahätmäs (great souls) receive transcendental messages from the realized devotees and thus gradually develop devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness and become so absorbed in transcendental service that they no longer desire elevation to any of the material planets, nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual planet. They only want Kåñëa’s association and nothing else. Such great souls in Kåñëa consciousness attain the highest perfection of life. In other words, they are the supreme souls.

Those who attain the highest material planets or the planets of the demigods are again subjected to repeated birth and death. As persons on earth are elevated to higher planets, people in higher planets such as Brahmaloka, Candraloka and Indraloka fall down to earth. The practice of sacrifice called païcägni-vidyä, recommended in the Kaöha Upaniñad, enables one to achieve Brahmaloka, but if, in Brahmaloka, one does not cultivate Kåñëa consciousness, then he must return to earth. Those who progress in Kåñëa consciousness in the higher planets are gradually elevated to higher and higher planets and at the time of universal devastation are transferred to the eternal spiritual kingdom. When there is devastation of this material universe, Brahmä and his devotees, who are constantly engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, are all transferred to the spiritual universe and to specific spiritual planets according to their desires.

There are also trees which are called “desire trees” that supply any type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows known as surabhi cows which supply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lakñmés), and He is called Govinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes.

All variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven.

It is clearly stated here that only by bhakti, or devotional service, can one enter into the Vaikuëöha (spiritual) planetary system. In all the Vaikuëöhas there is only one Supreme Godhead, Kåñëa, who has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. These plenary expansions are four-armed, and they preside over the innumerable spiritual planets. They are known by a variety of names―Puruñottama, Trivikrama, Keçava, Mädhava, Aniruddha, Håñékeça, Saìkarñaëa, Pradyumna, Çrédhara, Väsudeva, Dämodara, Janärdana, Näräyaëa, Vämana, Padmanäbha, etc. These plenary expansions are likened unto the leaves of a tree, and the main tree is likened to Kåñëa. Kåñëa, dwelling in Goloka Våndävana, His supreme abode, systematically conducts all affairs of both universes (material and spiritual) without a flaw by power of His all-pervasiveness.

They leave everything in Kåñëa’s hands and so easily and happily return to Godhead. But those who are not unalloyed devotees and who depend instead on such methods of spiritual realization as karma-yoga, jïäna-yoga, haöha-yoga, etc., must leave the body at a suitable time and thereby be assured whether or not they will return to the world of birth and death. If the yogé is perfect, he can select the time and place for leaving this material world, but if he is not so perfect, then he has to leave at nature’s will. The most suitable time to leave the body and not return is being explained by the Lord in these verses.

The best way to be absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness is to be always dovetailed in His service, and this will make one’s path to the spiritual kingdom safe, certain, and direct. The word yoga-yukta is especially significant in this verse. One who is firm in yoga is constantly engaged in Kåñëa consciousness in all his activities.

At the end he reaches the supreme abode. PURPORT This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth Chapters, particularly as the chapters deal with Kåñëa consciousness and devotional service. One has to study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A brahmacäré has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only under the master’s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for observing brahmacarya. After the student studies the Vedas under the master for a period from five to twenty years, he may become a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of character. After this training, the brahmacäré is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he also has to perform many sacrifices and strive for further enlightenment.

Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahmajyoti or in the Vaikuëöha planets or Kåñëaloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures. The beauty of Kåñëa consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all rituals of the different orders of life. One should try to understand the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of the Gétä not by scholarship or mental speculation, but by hearing them in association with pure devotees. Chapters Six through Twelve are the essence of the Gétä. If one is fortunate to understand the Gétä―especially these middle six chapters―in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc. One should hear the Gétä from the devotee because at the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated that the Géta can only be perfectly understood by devotees. Hearing the Gétä from devotees, not from mental speculators, is called faith. Through association of devotees, one is placed in devotional service, and by this service Kåñëa’s activities, form, pastimes, name, etc., become clear, and all misgivings are dispelled. Then once doubts are removed, the study of the Gétä becomes extremely pleasurable, and one develops a taste and feeling for Kåñëa consciousness. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with Kåñëa, and that is the beginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which prepares the devotee’s transferral to Kåñëa’s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka Våndävana, where the devotee enters into eternal happiness.

PURPORT As a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes enlightened. This hearing process is recommended in the Çrémad-Bhägavatam: “The messages of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies, and these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst devotees.

Lord Kåñëa, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and higher elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more confidential than any He has already disclosed. The very beginning of Bhagavad-gétä, the First Chapter, is more or less an introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third Chapters, the spiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the Seventh and Eighth Chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and because they bring enlightenment in Kåñëa consciousness, they are called more confidential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter deal with unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most confidential. One who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of Kåñëa is naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the material world. In the Bhakti-rasämåta-sindhu it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated. Similarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-gétä, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person. Now this first verse has specific significance. Knowledge (idaà jïänam) refers to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness, Kåñëa consciousness. At the time when one’s heart is cleared of the material contamination, one can understand this science of Kåñëa. Simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and spiritual activities by which one understands that he is not the body.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e557d86a-0fcb-49a8-80cc-a77937a3fc13":{"id_":"e557d86a-0fcb-49a8-80cc-a77937a3fc13","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d0d14760-32aa-4866-b024-edee40adc7b6","metadata":{},"hash":"hwrZ0i1u+d4MzdEN3efi4kUCcf4hq5qk459y8s6FgnY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"10c24ee4-b816-4b04-8cb9-74fc9a2b758a","metadata":{},"hash":"O0Ha5IJn4xSFYq4i61liyGeSgrG8CaIVs9anj82HpV8="}},"hash":"Osf6TXT7is4NJ0fUwgqg21c0Cl5ORtH81FMjKPvD/wE=","text":"understands that he is not the body.

Generally the commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on Bhagavad-gétä very inaccurately. Because they are envious of Kåñëa, their commentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are bona fide. No one can explain Bhagavad-gétä, or give perfect knowledge of Kåñëa if he is envious. One who criticizes the character of Kåñëa without knowing Him is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided. For one who understands that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial.

It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed. PURPORT This chapter of Bhagavad-gétä is called the king of education because it is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. There are seven principal philosophers in India: Gautama, Kaëäda, Kapila, Yäjïavalkya, Çäëòilya, Vaiçvänara, and, finally, Vyäsadeva, the author of the Vedänta-sütra. So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of the Vedas and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most confidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of all confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service. Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are educated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned, people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part of this body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value. Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for the vital soul. The Bhagavad-gétä, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the importance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is not perishable. That is a confidential part of knowledge: simply knowing that spirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive information about the soul.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"5dca1e2a-75fe-46f9-ad38-397e0daeb44e":{"id_":"5dca1e2a-75fe-46f9-ad38-397e0daeb44e","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"10c24ee4-b816-4b04-8cb9-74fc9a2b758a","metadata":{},"hash":"O0Ha5IJn4xSFYq4i61liyGeSgrG8CaIVs9anj82HpV8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7928ebe9-f7e2-421b-b086-b7a0d2ed9b26","metadata":{},"hash":"zVvRsqXjDabb2scbo5FQQMK6WlvU4QF2KYKykdckceI="}},"hash":"7+n7tSW1ZWxuDTBfa/ZSfYH+durtRDqh2ciL37cQGb4=","text":"But that gives no positive information about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But actually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge. This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as is explained in Vedic literature. In the Padma Puräëa, man’s sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers, bears fruit, and, when it is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we are enjoying as distress and pain, as explained in the twentieth verse of the Seventh Chapter. A person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa.

Therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest. Uttamam means transcendental. Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttamam means that which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with devotional service, however, will know that they are not material activities. They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature. It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of Kåñëa (Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare) in course of time feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of Kåñëa consciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one becomes pure.

But when his mother was engaged in serving great devotees, Närada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees himself. Närada personally says, “Once only, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food, and by so doing all my sins were at once eradicated. Thus being engaged, I became purified in heart, and at that time the very nature of the transcendentalist became attractive to me.” (Bhäg. 1.5.25) Närada tells his disciple Vyäsadeva that in a previous life he was engaged as a boy servant of purified devotees during four months of their stay and that he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees whether he could eat them, and they gave their permission. Närada then ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on eating, he gradually became as purehearted as the sages, and he gradually developed the same taste. The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing devotional service of the Lord, hearing, chanting, etc., and by developing the same taste, Närada wanted also to hear and chant the glories of the Lord. Thus by associating with the sages, he developed a great desire for devotional service. Therefore he quotes from the Vedänta-sütra (prakäçaç ca karmaëy abhyäsät): If one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. This is called prakäçaù, directly perceived. Närada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to school. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"36898292-b4aa-44a5-be0e-60c128141d2d":{"id_":"36898292-b4aa-44a5-be0e-60c128141d2d","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d7133503-9d23-4c69-b382-f030651018d6","metadata":{},"hash":"bUECMhamASN3rYkR18ISocmJvbshvS3YfPffyae53NQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b79b5387-cf11-406f-8ff5-64c1a71c2af4","metadata":{},"hash":"IqU7ZgCijGtFPftFGxE0FZfpfgs9dwP8Yh4IhXCtAUE="}},"hash":"RydWHA7X7gpurSYw/PAtq/M5IfibzS4u9gEeiNSAIPE=","text":"rendered some service to the devotees.

In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is said that religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of the stage of devotional service. Generally Vedic knowledge is required for the understanding of the path of self-realization. But here, although he was not educated in the Vedic principle, Närada acquired the highest results of Vedic study. This process is so potent that even without performing the religious process regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection. How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature: äcäryavän puruño veda. One who is in association with great äcäryas, even if he is not educated or has not studied the Vedas, can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for realization. The process of devotional service is a very happy one. Why? Devotional service consists of çravaëaà kértanaà viñëoù, so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized äcäryas.

Actual devotional service continues even after liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord. As it will be seen, actual devotional service begins after liberation. So in Bhagavad-gétä it is said, brahma-bhüta. After being liberated, or being situated in the Brahman position, one’s devotional service begins. By executing devotional service, one can understand the Supreme Lord. No one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, jïäna, or añöäìga-yoga or any other yoga independantly. Without coming to the stage of devotional service, one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing Çrémad-Bhägavatam or Bhagavad-gétä from realized souls, then he can understand the science of Kåñëa or the science of God. Evaà prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataù. When one’s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of Kåñëa consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it.

If one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith. Now the development of that faith is the process of Kåñëa consciousness. There are three divisions of Kåñëa conscious men. In the third class are those who have no faith. If they are engaged in devotional service officially, for some ulterior purpose, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most probably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because they haven’t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in Kåñëa consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to the Kåñëa consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a little well-situated, they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It is only by faith that one can advance in Kåñëa consciousness. As far as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a first-class person in Kåñëa consciousness. And in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have firm faith that Kåñëa bhakti or service to Kåñëa is the best course and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the third class who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow.

Sometimes these third-class persons in Kåñëa consciousness have some tendency toward karma-yoga and jïäna-yoga, and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection of karma-yoga or jïäna-yoga is vanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in Kåñëa consciousness. Faith in Kåñëa is also divided into three stages and described in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. First-class attachment, second-class attachment, and third-class attachment are also explained in Çrémad-Bhägavatam in the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after hearing about Kåñëa and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope in gaining perfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service.

All beings are in Me, but I am not in them. PURPORT The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses. It is said that Lord Çré Kåñëa’s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. In the Brahma- saàhitä it is stated, premäïjanacchurita.... One can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always within himself and outside himself if he has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. Here it is said that although He is all- pervading, everywhere present, He is yet not conceivable by the material senses. But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we have discussed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies, the superior spiritual energy and the inferior material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy. Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence. To refute such argument the Lord says, “I am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof.” For example, a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king’s energy; the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king’s power. But still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see, and everything that exists both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of His different energies, and, as is stated in the Bhagavad-gétä, He is everywhere present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies.

Sometimes we see a picture of Atlas holding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, holding this great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in connection with Kåñëa’s upholding this created universe. He says that although everything is resting on Him, still He is aloof. The planetary systems are floating in space, and this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is different from space. He is differently situated.

But when Kåñëa wants to do something, simply by His willing, everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done. The Lord explains this fact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer of all material manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation. Simply by His supreme will everything is created, everything is sustained, everything is maintained, and everything is annihilated. There is no difference between His mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present material mind) because He is absolute spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is present in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also present personally. He is different from this material manifestation, yet everything is resting on Him. This is explained here as yogam aiçvaram, the mystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION As the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, always rests in ethereal space know that in the same manner all beings rest in Me. PURPORT For the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material creation is resting in Him. But the Lord is giving an example which may help us to understand. Space is the biggest manifestation we can conceive. The cosmic manifestation rests in space. Space permits the movement of even the atoms and on up to the greatest planets, the sun and the moon. Although the sky (or wind or air) is great, still it is situated within space. Space is not beyond the sky. Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is being annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as space is always aloof from the activities of the atmosphere. In the Upaniñads, it is stated, “It is out of the fear of the Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing.” In the Garga Upaniñad also it is stated, “By the supreme order, under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun and the great planets are moving.” In the Brahma-saàhitä this is also stated. There is also a description of the movement of the sun, and it is said that the sun is considered to be one of the eyes of the Supreme Lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse heat and light. Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the supreme will of Govinda. So, from the Vedic literature we can find evidence that this material manifestation, which appears to us to be very wonderful and great, is under the complete control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This will be further explained in the later verses of this chapter.

Brahmä lives for one hundred years, and his one day is calculated at 4,300,000,000 of our earthly years. His night is of the same duration. His month consists of thirty such days and nights, and his year of twelve months. After one hundred such years, when Brahmä dies, the devastation or annihilation takes place; this means that the energy manifested by the Supreme Lord is again wound up in Himself. Then again, when there is need to manifest the cosmic world, it is done by His will: “Although I am one, I shall become many.” This is the Vedic aphorism. He expands Himself in this material energy, and the whole cosmic manifestation again takes place.

At the creation, the material energy is let loose as mahat-tattva, into which the Lord as His first Puruña incarnation, Mahä-Viñëu, enters. He lies within the Causal Ocean and breathes out innumerable universes, and into each universe the Lord again enters as Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. Each universe is in that way created. He still further manifests Himself as Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, and that Viñëu enters into everything—even into the minute atom. This fact is explained here. He enters into everything. Now, as far as the living entities are concerned, they are impregnated into this material nature, and as a result of their past deeds they take different positions.

The Supreme Lord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation, but the management is being conducted by material nature. Kåñëa also states in Bhagavad-gétä that of all the living entities in different forms and species, “I am the Father.” The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the child, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living entities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different forms and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these living entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, still take their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created immediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the manifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the småti: when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are detached from one another. There is a similar connection between the material world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In summary, material nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all material activities.

The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider Kå,sëa to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the Brahma-saàhitä (içvaraù paramaù kåsëaù); He is the Supreme Lord. There are many éçvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another. In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by another. In the Brahma-saàhitä it is said that Kåñëa is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly both in the material and spiritual world, but Kåñëa is the supreme controller (éçvaraù paramaù kåñëaù), and His body is sac-cid-änanda, non-material. Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge.

So this conception of Kåñëa is complete foolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His yogam aiçvaram, His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how Kåñëa, who appears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in Kåñëa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.

His appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transcendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of the Gétä also it is stated, tenaiva rüpeëa etc. Arjuna prayed to see again that form of four hands, and when Kåñëa was thus petitioned by Arjuna, He again assumed His original form. All these different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being. Some of those who deride Kåñëa, who are infected with the Mäyävädé philosophy, quote the following verse from the Çrémad-Bhägavatam to prove that Kåñëa is just an ordinary man: ahaà sarveñu bhüteñu bhütätmävasthitaù sadä: “The Supreme is present in every living entity.” (Bhäg. 3.29.21) We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vaiñëava äcäryas like Jéva Gosvämé instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride Kåñëa. Jéva Gosvämé, commenting on this verse, says that Kåñëa, in His plenary expansion as Paramätmä, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the arca-mürti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple.

Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected. There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity?

Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and Kåñëa are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to become one with Kåñëa will be baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the Vedänta-sütra and the Upaniñads, is always baffled.

Such a mahätmä, or great soul, develops through association with other mahätmäs, pure devotees. Pure devotees are not even attracted by Kåñëa’s other features, such as the four- armed Mahä-Viñëu.

TRANSLATION Others, who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge, worship the Supreme Lord as the one without a second, diverse in many, and in the universal form. PURPORT This verse is the summary of the previous verses. The Lord tells Arjuna that those who are purely in Kåñëa consciousness and do not know anything other than Kåñëa are called mahätmä; yet there are other persons who are not exactly in the position of mahätmä but who worship Kåñëa also, in different ways. Some of them are already described as the distressed, the financially destitute, the inquisitive, and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. But there are others who are still lower, and these are divided into three: 1) He who worships himself as one with the Supreme Lord, 2) He who concocts some form of the Supreme Lord and worships that, and 3) He who accepts the universal form, the viçvarüpa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that. Out of the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord, thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. Such people think themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship themselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a sense is prominent. Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in this way. The second class includes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by imagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord. And the third class includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of this material universe. They consider the universe to be the supreme organism or entity and worship that. The universe is also a form of the Lord.

The mantras chanted in this connection are also Kåñëa. And many other commodities made with milk products for offering in the sacrifices are also Kåñëa. The fire is also Kåñëa because fire is one of the five material elements and is therefore claimed as the separated energy of Kåñëa.

Or, in other words, those who are engaged in rendering devotional service unto Kåñëa are to be understood to have performed all the sacrifices recommended in the Vedas.

As such, these living entities who appear to be our father, mother, etc., are nothing but Kåñëa. In this verse the word dhätä means creator. Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of Kåñëa, but their creator, grandmother, and grandfather, etc., are also Kåñëa. Actually any living entity, being part and parcel of Kåñëa, is Kåñëa. All the Vedas, therefore, aim only toward Kåñëa.

Actually such planets, being the manifestations of Kåñëa’s energy, are also Kåñëa, but actually they only serve as a step forward for realization of Kåñëa. To approach the different energies of Kåñëa is to approach Kåñëa indirectly. One should directly approach Kåñëa, for that will save time and energy. For example, if there is a possibility of going to the top of a building by the help of an elevator, why should one go by the staircase, step by step? Everything is resting on Kåñëa’s energy; therefore without Kåñëa’s shelter nothing can exist. Kåñëa is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything exists on His energy. Kåñëa, being situated in everyone’s heart, is the supreme witness. The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also Kåñëa. Kåñëa is the ultimate goal of shelter, and as such one should take shelter of Kåñëa either for protection or for annihilation of his distressed condition. And whenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection must be a living force. Thus Kåñëa is the supreme living entity. Since Kåñëa is the source of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend than Kåñëa, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. Kåñëa is the original source of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation. Kåñëa is therefore the eternal cause of all causes.

PURPORT Kåñëa, by His different energies, diffuses heat and light through the agency of electricity and the sun. During summer season it is Kåñëa who checks rain from falling from the sky, and then, during the rainy season, He gives unceasing torrents of rain. The energy which sustains us by prolonging the duration of our life is Kåñëa, and Kåñëa meets us at the end as death. By analyzing all these different energies of Kåñëa, one can acertain that for Kåñëa there is no distinction between matter and spirit, or, in other words, He is both matter and spirit. In the advanced stage of Kåñëa consciousness, one does not therefore make such distinctions. He sees Kåñëa only in everything. Since Kåñëa is both matter and spirit, the gigantic universal form comprising all material manifestations is also Kåñëa, and His pastimes in Våndävana as two-handed Çyämasundara, playing on a flute, are those of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT If anyone has any desire to go to the moon, the sun, or any other planet, one can attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles recommended for that purpose. These are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the Vedas, technically known as darça-paurëamäsé, which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets. Similarly, one can attain the pitä planets by performing a specific yajïa. Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a yakña, rakña or piçäca. Piçäca worship is called “black arts” or “black magic.” There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of Vaikuëöha and Kåñëaloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the pitä achieve the pitä planets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of Kåñëa or Viñëu? Unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets where Kåñëa and Viñëu live, and because they do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from the brahmajyoti. This Kåñëa consciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare Kåñëa mantra one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to Godhead.

Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord Kåñëa Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it.

Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are said to be eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of Lord Kåñëa and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering, enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude of love. Kåñëa has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for Kåñëa. The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-gétä. To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of Kåñëa, the speaker of the Gétä. But, in actuality, Kåñëa, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that Kåñëa is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, Kåñëa has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature. And so in this instance, Kåñëa’s hearing the devotee’s words of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts Kåñëa as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.

Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are given to Kåñëa, then that is called yukta-vairägya. Actually situated in renunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Anyone who has no other interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the Lord is actually a sannyäsé Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal servant, dependant on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he does, he does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he performs it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas. For ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas, but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not so.

But this is not discrimination; it is natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children.

He is just like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His devotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always in Kåñëa consciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in Kåñëa. The very phrase Kåñëa consciousness suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him.

When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord, he looks like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in a pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is. The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is the manifestation of the Lord’s special mercy to the devotees. The Lord’s reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma. It belongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function. Devotional service of the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is part of the spiritual world where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate.

TRANSLATION Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service, he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated. PURPORT The word suduräcäro used in this verse is very significant, and we should understand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the conditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome condition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization of Kåñëa consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a person in Kåñëa consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that if a person falls down, but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, beautifies him and excuses him from that abomination.

Therefore a person who is situated in Kåñëa consciousness and is engaged with determination in the process of chanting Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare should be considered to be in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen. The words sädhur eva, “he is saintly,” are very emphatic. They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has fallen down accidentally. And the word mantavyaù is still more emphatic. If one does not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown, then he is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service. The mark of a spot which may be seen on the moon does not become an impediment to the moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of a saintly character does not make him abominable.

Therefore devotional service and guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most simple man taking center of the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance. According to the different modes of material nature, men are classified in the mode of goodness (brähmaëas), the mode of passion (kñatriyas, or administrators), the mixed modes of passion and ignorance (vaiçyas, or merchants), and the mode of ignorance (çüdras, or workers). Those lower than them are called caëòälas, and they are born in sinful families. Generally, those who are born in sinful families are not accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service and the pure devotee of the Supreme God are so strong that all the lower classes can attain the highest perfection of life. This is possible only when one takes center of Kåñëa. One has to take center completely of Kåñëa. Then one can become much greater than great jïänés and yogés.

While Kåñëa was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore great sages like Paräçara Muni have all accepted Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now Kåñëa is instructing Arjuna in more confidential knowledge of His opulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord already explained His different energies and how they are acting.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"7e7b37bf-4d1c-4280-9989-c1a30bacc9b0":{"id_":"7e7b37bf-4d1c-4280-9989-c1a30bacc9b0","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"defabb0f-1302-45b3-8e6c-306702311d3e","metadata":{},"hash":"2b6U0gb5mRuzr34NnatkyxWMWKfOkQsHL3/XAjPGPuc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9d34052e-1a27-423a-bd8a-918d1fbd238c","metadata":{},"hash":"8lG9VNhbG2oT6f0CoVztvg54SEhewPgQ/DTS4vB2wIA="}},"hash":"DnkDD0Um5U2MCF/XrLSfikBdcImueyWviqkgiTK8vM0=","text":"Seventh Chapter, the Lord already explained His different energies and how they are acting.

The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material attachment. The conditional souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not changeable.

All the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as Kåñëa is concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore Kåñëa is different even from the great demigods like Brahmä and Çiva.

The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very material mask is inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious.

Such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as Çrémad- Bhägavatam and Bhagavad-gétä, or from a bona fide spiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There is no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sannyäsa. Anyone acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sannyäsé and a yogé, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sannyäsé, or a pseudo-yogé.

Anything favorable for the development of Kåñëa consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be rejected. Bhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the beginning of Bhagavad-gétä. Birth and death apply to one’s embodiment in the material world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in Kåñëa consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright. Others, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of what the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant anxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand Kåñëa and be situated always in Kåñëa consciousness. In that way we will be free from all fear. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam. it is stated that fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory energy, but those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are confident that they are not the material body, that they are spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are therefore engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear. Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are not in Kåñëa consciousness. Bhayam, fearlessness, is only possible for one in Kåñëa consciousness.

The human body is meant for spiritual realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end commit violence on the human body.

Similarly, that which is favorable for prosecuting Kåñëa consciousness should be accepted; that which is unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samatä, equanimity. A person in Kåñëa consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept unless it is useful in the prosecution of Kåñëa consciousness. Tuñöiù, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with whatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction. Tapas means austerity or penance.

As far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in terms of Kåñëa consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but it is the best cause. Because Kåñëa is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be given to a person who is engaged in Kåñëa consciousness. According to Vedic literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the brähmaëas. This practice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic injunction. But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the brähmaëas. Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge. A brähmaëa is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Brahman. A brahma-jana is one who knows Brahman; he is called a brähmaëa. Thus charity is offered to the brähmaëas because since they are always engaged in higher spiritual service, they have no time to earn their livelihood. In the Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to the renouncer of life, the sannyäsé. The sannyäsés beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the householders from the slumber of ignorance.

All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on other planets, and these qualities are there.

And from Brahmä all the seven great sages, and before them four other great sages, named Sanaka, Sananda, Sanätana, and Sanatkumära, and the Manus, are manifest.

Prakäçänanda, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion, but even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by Kåñëa Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in Kåñëa consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness. The modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.

Man can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand Kåñëa or the Supreme Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, Kåñëa, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee. The pure devotee always has Kåñëa within his heart; therefore he is just like the sun that dissipates the darkness of ignorance. This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by Kåñëa. Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of births, one’s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare Kåñëa, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal of Viñëu can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about the necessities of life; he need not be anxious because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, for He is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is the essence of the Gétä’s teachings. By studying Bhagavad-gétä, one can become a completely surrendered soul to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors.

Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-gétä in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, “You are Parambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” And previously Kåñëa states that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every human being is dependant on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independant of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa. That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This is already explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not because Kåñëa is an intimate friend of Arjuna that he is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction. In the Kena Upaniñad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and Kåñëa has already explained that everything is resting on Him. The Muëòaka Upaniñad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him. This constant thinking of Kåñëa is smaraëam, one of the methods of devotional service. It is only by devotional service to Kåñëa that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body. In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure.

One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna’s acceptance of Kåñëa as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also confirmed by great personalities, of whom Närada is the chief. Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him and enjoy one’s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures. the Puräëas and histories. In all Vedic literatures Kåñëa is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, “Although I am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles.” He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord. Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of Kåñëa. If we want to understand Bhagavad-gétä, we should accept the statements in these two verses. This is called the paramparä system, acceptance of the disciplic succession. Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-gétä. It is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Kåñëa is an ordinary person.

He is not even known by the demigods, so what to speak of the so-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is Kåñëa and that He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority of Bhagavad-gétä. As described in the Fourth Chapter, the paramparä system of disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-gétä was lost, and therefore Kåñëa reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to Gétopaniñad, Bhagavad-gétä should be understood in the paramparä system. When the paramparä system was lost, Arjuna was again selected to rejuvenate it. The acceptance of Arjuna of all that Kåñëa says should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-gétä, and then only can we understand that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A liberated man and even a common man may realize impersonal Brahman or localized Paramätmä, yet they may not understand God’s personality from the verses of Bhagavad-gétä, which are being spoken by this person, Kåñëa.

No common man, including the demons and atheists, can know Kåñëa because He is guarded by His yoga-mäyä energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is not only concerned for his own understanding, but for the understanding of all mankind. Out of his mercy, because he is a Vaiñëava, a devotee, Arjuna is opening the understanding for the common man as far as the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme is concerned. He addresses Kåñëa specifically as yogin because Çré Kåñëa is the master of the yoga-mäyä energy by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no love for Kåñëa cannot always think of Kåñëa; therefore he has to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world. Because materialists cannot understand Kåñëa spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how Kåñëa is manifested by physical representations.

TRANSLATION Tell me again in detail, O Janärdana [Kåñëa], of Your mighty potencies and glories, for I never tire of hearing Your ambrosial words. PURPORT A similar statement was made to Süta Gosvämé by the åñis of Naimiñäraëya, headed by Çaunaka. That statement is: vayaà tu na vitåpyäma uttama-çloka-vikrame yac chåëvatäà rasa-jïänäà svädu svädu pade pade. “One can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the transcendental pastimes of Kåñëa, who is glorified by Vedic hymns. Those who have entered into a transcendental relationship with Kåñëa relish in every step descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord.” Thus Arjuna is interested to hear about Kåñëa, specifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord. Now as far as amåtam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement concerning Kåñëa is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories, but one never tires of hearing about Kåñëa. It is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. For instance, the Puräëas are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord. In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings.

PURPORT It is not possible to comprehend the greatness of Kåñëa and His opulences. The senses of the individual soul are imperfect and do not permit him to understand the totality of Kåñëa’s affairs. Still the devotees try to understand Kåñëa, but not on the principle that they will be able to understand Kåñëa fully at any specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of Kåñëa are so relishable that they appear to them as nectar. Thus they enjoy them. In discussing Kåñëa’s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them. Kåñëa knows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different energies. The word prädhänyataù (principal) is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His features are unlimited.

The impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energy. Both in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every variety of manifestation.

PURPORT In this verse Arjuna is addressed as Guòäkeça, which means one who has conquered the darkness of sleep. For those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance, it is not possible to understand how the Supreme Godhead manifests Himself in the material and spiritual worlds. Thus this address by Kåñëa to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"04b514bb-10c0-4311-87ee-839aa292f703":{"id_":"04b514bb-10c0-4311-87ee-839aa292f703","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"61b658fe-df60-4038-9440-5213e5d7e054","metadata":{},"hash":"3wL3QSFjsLZDmD85xLyWvaosYdeTM21+2g/YG5Oh/9c="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0b97d9ea-843f-4684-aad7-97a63c5c736d","metadata":{},"hash":"Is+NqBcX/H9UmC2pObr1KeXlaYRU/mwIBqhY8tIbH+0="}},"hash":"qH1bLHHUhSnflVoCqgB6kL0jYCDKNHNjN6enVSjj8WY=","text":"Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences. Kåñëa first informs Arjuna that He is the Self or soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the Puruña incarnations, and from Him everything begins. Therefore He is ätmä, the soul of the mahat- tattva, the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the creation, but actually the Mahä-Visëu enters into the mahat-tattva, the total material energy. He is the soul. When Mahä-Viñëu enters into the manifested universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the spiritual spark, the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop unless the Supreme Soul of Kåñëa enters. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all manifested universes. A description of the three puruña-avatäras is given in Çrémad-Bhägavatam. “The Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests three features, as Käraëodakaçäyé Visëu, Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu and Kñérodakaçäyé Viñëu, in this material manifestation.” The Supreme Lord Kåñëa, the cause of all causes, lies down in the cosmic ocean as Mahä-Viñëu or Käraëodakaçäyé Viñëu, and therefore Kåñëa is the beginning of this universe, the maintainer of the universal manifestation, and the end of all the energy.

The most powerful of his sons is Bhågu, who is also the greatest sage. Of all the transcendental vibrations, the “om” (omkara) represents the Supreme. Of all the sacrifices, the chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare is the purest representation of Kåñëa. Sometimes animal sacrifices are recommended, but in the sacrifice of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, there is no question of violence. It is the simplest and the purest. Whatever is sublime in the worlds is a representation of Kåñëa. Therefore the Himalayas, the greatest mountains in the world, also represent Him. The mountain named Meru was mentioned in a previous verse, but Meru is sometimes movable, whereas the Himalayas are never movable. Thus the Himalayas are greater than Meru.

Amongst the demigods they also worship Närada, who is considered the greatest devotee in the universe. Thus he is the representation of Kåñëa as a devotee.

From the nectar were produced many entities, of which there was a horse named Uccaiùçravä. Another animal produced from the nectar was an elephant named Airävata.

Of months I am November and December, and of seasons I am flower-bearing spring. PURPORT It has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the Vedas, the Säma-veda is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods. One of these songs is the Båhat-säma, which has an exquisite melody and is sung at midnight. In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter are not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry. Amongst the regulated poetry, the Gäyatré mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified brähmaëas, is the most prominent. The Gäyatré mantra is mentioned in the Çrémad- Bhägavatam. Because the Gäyatré mantra is especially meant for God realization, it represents the Supreme Lord. This mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the Gäyatré mantra. The Gäyatré mantra is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound incarnation of Brahman. Brahmä is its initiator, and it is passed down from him in disciplic succession. The months of November and December are considered the best of all months because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, and the people become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because it is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating Kåñëa’s pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it is the representative of the Supreme Lord Kåñëa.

Among those who are trying to be victorious in some field of activity, the most victorious element is morality. Among the confidential activities of hearing, thinking and meditating, silence is most important because by silence one can make progress very quickly.

The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to Kåñëa’s entering them as Supersoul. From Brahmä, the most gigantic entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them. Worship of demigods is discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like Brahmä and Çiva only represent part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is samatä, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In the Viñëu-mantra it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord Kåñëa in the same category with demigods―be they even Brahmä or Çiva―becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of Kåñëa’s energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord Çré Kåñëa and can fix his mind in the worship of Kåñëa without deviation. The Lord is all- pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"c52c8a15-ef2e-488d-9681-82bba6e389d2":{"id_":"c52c8a15-ef2e-488d-9681-82bba6e389d2","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"596a8ffe-ef62-4115-8ed7-39297fdb3d6a","metadata":{},"hash":"cUTpETtoUzdofoLCEEPS7F9Zspww9Po14HnQNvuOz78="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b48d144e-87a8-4737-9de3-7cc3157ae3e8","metadata":{},"hash":"/PIlFQPsIwOcFF56+gJwjzT92/BjZE8KF6uIhR3DrZA="}},"hash":"22UXh0rCCtveo9smrYxwufQbb2YCigmTDfATU7tLcVU=","text":"enters into everything that is.

Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has a great friend like Kåñëa, but now he is thinking that although he may accept Kåñëa as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to establish Kåñëa’s divinity for all, he is requesting Kåñëa in this chapter to show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of Kåñëa one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but Kåñëa is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what Kåñëa says several times. Kåñëa is speaking to him just for his benefit, and Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by Kåñëa’s grace. He is now convinced that Kåñëa is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul.

Arjuna’s asking the Lord’s permission is also significant. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His universal form, for he is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of Kåñëa. But He can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to convince others. He did not have any personal desire for confirmation. Kåñëa also understands that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people, therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be Kåñëa should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people.

PURPORT It is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the Supreme Lord, Kåñëa, by the material senses. But if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges Kåñëa’s inestimable position. Arjuna could understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word yogeçvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable power. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is unlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of Kåñëa. He does not give Kåñëa orders. Kåñëa is not obliged to reveal Himself to anyone unless one surrenders fully in Kåñëa consciousness and engages in devotional service. Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental speculations to see Kåñëa.

PURPORT Arjuna wanted to see Kåñëa in His universal form, which, although a transcendental form, is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is therefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature. As the material nature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal form of Kåñëa is manifested and unmanifested. It is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like Kåñëa’s other forms. As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see Kåñëa in this way, Kåñëa reveals this form. This universal form is not possible to be seen by any ordinary man. Kåñëa must give one the power to see it.

Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with Kåñëa are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The playmates of Kåñëa, the friends of Kåñëa and the parents of Kåñëa never want Kåñëa to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving exchange they forget that Kåñëa is the Supreme Lord. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated that the boys who play with Kåñëa are all highly pious souls, and after many, many births they are able to play with Kåñëa. Such boys do not know that Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal friend. The Supreme Person is considered as the impersonal Brahman by great sages, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the devotees, and as a product of this material nature by ordinary men. The fact is that the devotee is not concerned to see the viçva-rüpa, the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate Kåñëa’s statement so that in the future people could understand that Kåñëa not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm this because Arjuna is the beginning of the paramparä system. Those who are actually interested to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that Kåñëa not only theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme. The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already explained.

TRANSLATION The Blessed Lord said: Time I am, destroyer of the worlds, and I have come to engage all people. With the exception of you [the Päëòavas], all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain. PURPORT Although Arjuna knew that Kåñëa was his friend and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was nonetheless puzzled by the various forms exhibited by Kåñëa. Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force. It is written in the Vedas that the Supreme Truth destroys everything, even Brahmä. Yasya brahme ca kñatram ca ubhe bhavata odanaù/måtyur yasyopasecanaà ka itthä veda yatra saù. Eventually all the brähmaëas, kñatriyas and everyone else are devoured by the Supreme. This form of the Supreme Lord is an all-devouring giant, and here Kåñëa presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time. Except for a few Päëòavas, everyone who was present in that battlefield would be devoured by Him. Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight; then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that is His plan. If he stopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death cannot be checked, even if he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord. That is the law of nature.

O refuge of the universe, You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation. PURPORT By this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that Kåñëa is worshipable by everyone. He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna is addressing Kåñëa as mahätmä, which means that He is most magnanimous and unlimited. Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the influence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and deveça means that He is the controller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the center of the whole universe. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and all powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him because no one is greater than Him. He especially mentions that Kåñëa is greater than Brahmä because Brahmä is created by Him. Brahmä is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu, who is Kåñëa’s plenary expansion; therefore Brahmä and Lord Çiva, who is born of Brahmä, and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. Thus the Lord is respected by Lord Çiva and Brahmä and similar other demigods. The word akñaram is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction, but the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the all-great Supreme.

PURPORT Although Kåñëa is manifested before Arjuna in His universal form, Arjuna remembers his friendly relationship with Kåñëa and is therefore asking pardon and requesting Him to excuse him for the many informal gestures which arise out of friendship. He is admitting that formerly he did not know that Kåñëa could assume such a universal form, although He explained it as his intimate friend. Arjuna did not know how many times he may have dishonored Him by addressing Him as “O my friend, O Kåñëa, O Yädava,” etc., without acknowledging His opulence. But Kåñëa is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence He played with Arjuna as a friend. Such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the devotee and the Lord. The relationship between the living entity and Kåñëa is fixed eternally; it cannot be forgotten, as we can see from the behavior of Arjuna. Although Arjuna has seen the opulence in the universal form, he could not forget his friendly relationship with Kåñëa.

He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahmä, and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-gétä to Arjuna; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from Kåñëa. Without being a representative of Kåñëa, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter. The Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, because no one is equal to or higher than Kåñëa within any manifestation, spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him. The Supreme Lord Kåñëa has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, body, mind and Himself. Foolish persons who do not know Him perfectly say that Kåñëa is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else. Kåñëa is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme.

Therefore please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe. PURPORT Arjuna is always in confidence with Kåñëa because he is a very dear friend, and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend’s opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to see that his friend, Kåñëa, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form. But at the same time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to Kåñëa out of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking Kåñëa to show His Näräyaëa form because He can assume any form. This universal form is material and temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaikuëöha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as Näräyaëa. There are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them Kåñëa is present by His plenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaikuëöha planets. Of course in each Vaikuëöha planet the form of Näräyaëa is four-handed, and the four hands hold different symbols, the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc. According to the different hands these four things are held in, the Näräyaëas are named. All of these forms are one and the same to Kåñëa; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature.

PURPORT In the Brahmä-saàhitä it is stated that the Lord is eternally situated in hundreds and thousands of forms, and the main forms are those like Räma, Nåsiàha, Näräyaëa, etc. There are innumerable forms. But Arjuna knew that Kåñëa is the original Personality of Godhead assuming His temporary universal form. He is now asking to see the form of Näräyaëa, a spiritual form. This verse establishes without any doubt the statement of the Çrémad-Bhägavatam that Kåñëa is the original Personality of Godhead and all other features originate from Him. He is not different from His plenary expansions, and He is God in any of His innumerable forms. In all of these forms He is fresh like a young man. That is the constant feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who knows Kåñëa at once becomes free from all contamination of the material world.

No one before you has ever seen this unlimited and glaringly effulgent form. PURPORT Arjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so out of His mercy upon His devotee Arjuna, Lord Kåñëa showed His universal form full of effulgence and opulence.

Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Viñëu are demigods. Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Viñëu, or who only recognize the impersonal part of Kåñëa as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry Kåñëa and at the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna. The Bhagavad-gétä gives the description of the universal form, and this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna. Now one can have some idea of the viçva-rüpa after this incidence; those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of Kåñëa. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested to see the universal form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord Kåñëa as Viñëu, and he was actually afraid of the universal form. In this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yajïädhya-yanaiù, which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial regulations.

So one can perform all these, can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-gétä we understand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord. There are many persons who create incarnations.

We should follow the principles of Bhagavad-gétä, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-gétä is considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that one can distinguish what is what.

But some think that even though He was so powerful, He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on Kåñëa and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of Kåñëa which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-gétä, Chapter Two: to hear about Kåñëa from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about Kåñëa from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, Kåñëa becomes dear.

Kåñëa consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by Rüpa Gosvämé as the most munificent man of charity because love of Kåñëa, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him.

The very word sudurdarçam, meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw that universal form. It also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by Kåñëa at the request of Arjuna because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form. Kåñëa changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of Näräyaëa and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four- handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed Kåñëa. He is the origin of all emanations. Kåñëa is distinct even from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of Kåñëa are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of Kåñëa (which is known as Mahä-Viñëu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge.

The original is the Kåñëa form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God’s original form. The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of Kåñëa. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with Kåñëa in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who is a constant companion of Kåñëa’s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the two-handed form of Kåñëa is the most dear.

Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely Kåñëaloka, Goloka Våndävana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word mad-bhaktaù, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect. The term saìga-varjitaù is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against Kåñëa. Not only are the atheistic persons against Kåñëa, but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation.

Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always Kåñëa conscious in every respect, but that Kåñëa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of Kåñëa twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and Kåñëa at last killed him.

PURPORT Kåñëa has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yogés. Generally, the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord.

Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but Kåñëa indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association with the Godhead. In the Second Chapter the Lord explains that a living entity is not the material body but is a spiritual spark, a part of the Absolute Truth. In the Seventh Chapter He speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. In the Eighth Chapter it is stated that whoever thinks of Kåñëa at the moment of death is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, Kåñëa’s abode. And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord says that out of all the yogés, he who thinks of Kåñëa within himself is considered to be the most perfect. So throughout the Gétä personal devotion to Kåñëa is recommended as the highest form of spiritual realization. Yet there are those who are still attracted to Kåñëa’s impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence, which is the all-pervasive aspect of the Absolute Truth and which is unmanifest and beyond the reach of the senses. Arjuna would like to know which of these two types of transcendentalists is more perfect in knowledge. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of Kåñëa. He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants to say, “What is the use of such a waste of time?”","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"70f354fe-50e8-4030-91a3-ea9f4ce7fac1":{"id_":"70f354fe-50e8-4030-91a3-ea9f4ce7fac1","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b9b1b5bf-6259-4e5e-9fd9-10a9601283e2","metadata":{},"hash":"MK96lb7pmxjMeuyPQSuDEWE52WpdG5dP+vVGuqUmOtU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f90cc23a-bbdc-4103-a7d8-55f92e93d1d4","metadata":{},"hash":"OGQ1Gi2yWRJsbANW2hZZ6m/n4NuykkN9n63HY0/51QQ="}},"hash":"L+ZwW8ZZnv/RnM9qWkDPLdVcB5mglK73gqhDnJgviBk=","text":"such a waste of time?” Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of Kåñëa is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for Kåñëa.

PURPORT Those who do not directly worship the Supreme Godhead, Kåñëa, but who attempt to achieve the same goal by an indirect process, also ultimately achieve the supreme goal, Çré Kåñëa, as is stated, “After many births the man of wisdom seeks refuge in Me, knowing Väsudeva is all.” When a person comes to full knowledge after many births, he surrenders unto Lord Kåñëa. If one approaches the Godhead by the method mentioned in this verse, he has to control the senses, render service to everyone and engage in the welfare of all beings. It is inferred that one has to approach Lord Kåñëa, otherwise there is no perfect realization. Often there is much penance involved before one fully surrenders unto Him. In order to perceive the Supersoul within the individual soul, one has to cease the sensual activities of seeing, hearing, tasting, working, etc. Then one comes to understand that the Supreme Soul is present everywhere. Realizing this, one envies no living entity―he sees no difference between man and animal because he sees soul only, not the outer covering. But for the common man, this method of impersonal realization is very difficult.

TRANSLATION For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progrese in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied. PURPORT The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called jïäna-yogés, and persons who are in full Kåñëa consciousness, engaged in devotional service to the Lord, are called bhakti-yogés. Now, here the difference between jïäna- yoga and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The process of jïäna-yoga, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the bhakti-yogé accepts the Deity of Kåñëa as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be saguëa and nirguëa—of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguëa worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood, or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.

We may find some mailboxes on the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation, which we may find somewhere, which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent and all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arca-vigraha, He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life. So, for a devotee, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization, the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upaniñads, and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and they have to realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common man. A person in Kåñëa consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk, trouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar passage appears in Çrémad-Bhägavatam.

Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of self-realization because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result. A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of jïäna-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independant, and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual blissful self. One should not take up this process. For every individual living entity the process of Kåñëa consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus this process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by Lord Kåñëa.

TRANSLATION Just fix your mind upon Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and engage all your intelligence in Me. Thus you will live in Me always, without a doubt. PURPORT One who is engaged in Lord Kåñëa’s devotional service lives in a direct relationship with the Supreme Lord, so there is no doubt that his position is transcendental from the very beginning. A devotee does not live on the material plane—he lives in Kåñëa. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa and His internal potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee. When he offers Kåñëa food, Kåñëa directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes Kåñëa-ized by eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand how this is so, although this is a process recommended in the Gétä and in other Vedic literatures.

PURPORT In this verse, two different processes of bhakti-yoga are indicated. The first applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for one who has not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love. For this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations, which one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to Kåñëa. Bhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in material existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification. But, by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become purified, and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don’t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"ab5f7393-1be4-4245-86aa-f96f4d9453cc":{"id_":"ab5f7393-1be4-4245-86aa-f96f4d9453cc","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"aa974879-3b3b-43d6-83b1-52ac5091be81","metadata":{},"hash":"rd60Gt7ozMx2AdDnDoSWQGvif+i7pdbOhq61Scd/pXg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9734ba6d-d089-4333-be23-27963857238e","metadata":{},"hash":"dZ0KoPadAJ0f7KY9HknaBwLwnBIcpnO5JJeNtmm8Ab4="}},"hash":"v5ALY+/4CDHn4bdi6OFVCfvuRrt4AdQjZ7N5jOL7XWg=","text":"I simply serve to get some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage of love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service, performed with the present senses. This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone’s heart. And, there, love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by the material association. Now the material association has to be purified, and that dormant, natural love for Kåñëa has to be revived. That is the whole process. To practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and chant Hare Kåñëa, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to offer to the Deity, take prasädam, and so on. There are various rules and regulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear Bhagavad-gétä and Çrémad-Bhägavatam from pure devotees. This practice can help anyone to rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress into the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga, under the rules and regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one to the stage of love of God.

PURPORT One who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of bhakti- yoga, under the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this perfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord. How to do this work has already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One should be sympathetic to the propagation of Kåñëa consciousness. There are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of Kåñëa consciousness, and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulated principles of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land, capital, organization, and labor. Just as, in business, one requires a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor, and some organization to expand, so the same is required in the service of Kåñëa. The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction of Kåñëa, and that is spiritual activity. If one has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagating Kåñëa consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one cannot sacrifice the result of such activities, the same person can still sacrifice some percentage to propagate Kåñëa consciousness. This voluntary service to the cause of Kåñëa consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect.

If one attaches himself directly to the activities of Kåñëa consciousness, there may be objection from family members, or so many other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions of the pumundi or special work in which the result of one’s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of Kåñëa consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of one’s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand Kåñëa consciousness.

For those who are actually not able to follow the principles of Kåñëa consciousness, it is better to cultivate knowledge because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. There are processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the brähmaëas, vaiçyas, and çüdras, which we shall find in a later chapter of Bhagavad-gétä. But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result of karma for some good cause. In summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service in Kåñëa consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of one’s activities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may either take the step by step process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is for others who are not at this state; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-gétä is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"f0184645-3442-42a8-aacc-8425e854ea3f":{"id_":"f0184645-3442-42a8-aacc-8425e854ea3f","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ab18a27d-4279-47e4-b2f3-093f3b04df2c","metadata":{},"hash":"rF5Lzg3/Pq170UMIXwRvKStylxwxcgHkKOK4misy6FI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"bb007d19-6ebb-49f3-889c-93199a2e9146","metadata":{},"hash":"AGbjP7bj7pJz/GTA7v8/N47RVDsRd+pONDAYT57tAZE="}},"hash":"1DD6jCQKstwSihZQgUk7hrlHc9hrR5G2vefy+F2IfMw=","text":"Bhagavad-gétä is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed.

PURPORT Coming again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing the transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone. Nor does a devotee become his enemy’s enemy; he thinks that one is acting as his enemy due to his own past misdeeds. Thus it is better to suffer than to protest. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is stated: tat te ’nukampäà su- samékñyamaëo. Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that it is the Lord’s mercy upon him. He thinks: “Thanks to my past misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to the peace and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He does not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equiposed both in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled, he is determined.

But a devotee is always transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or happiness. He is very patient. He does not speak of anything but the topics about Kåñëa; therefore he is called silent. Silent does not mean that one should not speak; silent means that one should not speak nonsense. One should speak only of essentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak of the Supreme Lord. He is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor does he care for any residential facility. He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may sometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is called fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge. We may find some repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but this is just to give an illustration of the fact that a devotee must acquire all these qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure devotee. One who is not a devotee has no good qualification. One who wants to be recognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications. Of course he does not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but engagement in Kåñëa consciousness and devotional service automatically helps him develop them.

In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association, one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord.

The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in Kåñëa consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step by step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-gétä, is more congenial. One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.

The conditioned soul is entrapped in material existence, and he attempts to lord over material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a field of activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is the body? The body is made of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and, according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or field of activity. Therefore the body is called kñetra, or the field of activity for the conditioned soul. Now, the person who does not identify himself with the body is called kñetrajïa, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to understand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the knower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the actual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that he is different from the body.

In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, Kåñëa says, “I am also the knower, but I am not the individual owner of the body. I am the superknower. I am present in every body as the Paramätmä, or Supersoul.” One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-gétä, can attain to knowledge. The Lord says: “I am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body.” The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies. The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is Håñékeça, which means controller of the senses.

Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as jïänam. That is the opinion of Kåñëa. To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prakåti, nature, and puruña, the enjoyer of the nature, and éçvara, the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul. One should not confuse the three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language: “bhoktä bhogyaà preritäraà ca matvä sarvaà proktaà tri-vidhaà brahmam etat.” There are three Brahman conceptions: prakåti is Brahman as the field of activities, and the jéva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller. In this chapter it will be also explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"757c38d4-6c2f-48c7-ab38-dc2329fa7fe2":{"id_":"757c38d4-6c2f-48c7-ab38-dc2329fa7fe2","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d1a41b77-d99d-4478-a4c6-ee2d3917710b","metadata":{},"hash":"YuCQtMRK4W7w1S5Nw1JNQjmTpQzlEmJpq5/uRVk7EPU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b76bdf14-8d68-4a20-b4f0-688e305c3a38","metadata":{},"hash":"eRYHKh1hottMELITKzGXWILSKaPQWU8mexdxaV+IQKM="}},"hash":"L9XPqeZsPxY5DpxX9bBjXwBdzitl5TBIW/6ZghzUcYM=","text":"fallible and the other is infallible.

Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. Kåñëa is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and non-duality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to Scriptures, the Vedänta, which are accepted as authority. First, He says, this is according to different sages. As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyäsadeva, the author of the Vedänta-sütra, is a great sage, and in the Vedänta-sütra duality is perfectly explained. And Vyäsadeva’s father, Paräçara, was also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity: “aham tvaà ca athänye...” “We—you, I and various other living entities—are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental.” Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Kaöha Upaniñad. There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord’s energy known as annamaya by which one depends simply upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then there is präëamaya; this means that after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in foodstuff, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms, or life forms. In jïänamaya the living symptom develops to the point of thinking, feeling, and willing.

Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called änandamaya. In the Vedänta-sütra also the Supreme is called änandamayo ’bhyäsät. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy, and to enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vijïänamaya, präëamaya, jïänamaya, and annamaya. In this field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the änandamaya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy, in dovetailing himself with the änandamaya, then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord, as supreme knower of the field, the living entity, as subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities.

One who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their interactions should study the philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-gétä, a summary only is given. The body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of the body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it produces by-products, then begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes.

If one accepts this process, then the possibility of approaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the tenfold elements, as described before, This is actually the means to get out of it. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described in the first line of the tenth verse: The process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So, if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But, if one takes to devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him. The principle of accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the seventh verse, is essential. Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense. As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows: Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge―who knows that he is not this body―anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion, one enters into some group, which is not actually following religious principles, and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.

So, unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement. That is nonviolence. Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected because material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahläda, who, only five years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahlada tolerated him. So, for making advancement in spiritual knowledge, there may be many impediments, but we should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination. Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the spiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kåñëa, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciple’s following the regulated principles. Or, the regulated principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation. Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are two kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means taking a bath, but for internal cleanliness, one has to think of Kåñëa always and chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma. Hare Räma, Räma Räma Hare Hare.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e57ec1ba-0936-4243-a1c3-31e61625a906":{"id_":"e57ec1ba-0936-4243-a1c3-31e61625a906","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d7127779-752d-4b3c-a672-769371f09faa","metadata":{},"hash":"71FuAzYB+Vp1Soz8e35p736liTgmW3/UbIzF+vSPUnk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"75649e94-7b70-4126-9ad9-23068fa8f5eb","metadata":{},"hash":"M8GGAcWPL/TICczfce1/X7snSxTqHEzzdstycUT8EPs="}},"hash":"11l0njyN15yIm0Gg2Lrp2Y3/LeblFNF9xskaAhih+2g=","text":"Hare Räma, Räma Räma Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind. Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress. And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This is real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kåñëa and chanting Hare Kåñëa. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kåñëa. That will control the eyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kåñëa and the nose in smelling the flowers offered to Kåñëa. This is the process of devotional service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gétä is simply expounding the science of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole objective. Unintelligent commentators on the Gétä try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-gétä but devotional service. False ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul, that is real ego. Ego is there. False ego is condemned, but not real ego.

There are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the false identification with the body. One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of the mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death, there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these. Unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual life. As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection, but when they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to them.

If one can mold his family life in this way to develop Kåñëa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to change from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned. One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Kåñëa, just as Arjuna did. Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that these family members were impediments to his Kåñëa realization, he accepted the instruction of Kåñëa and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be detached from the happiness and distress of family life because in this world one can never be fully happy or fully miserable. Happiness and distress are concommitant factors of material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gétä. One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equiposed in both cases.

But if we are actually in the spiritual position, these things will not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional service; devotional service to Kåñëa without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional service, chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc., as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed. Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. That would go against his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place without unwanted association. Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-gétä, such research work and philosophical speculation have no value. That is more or less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-gétä, one should make research by philosophical discretion into the nature of the soul. One should make research to understand with what the self is concerned. That is recommended here. As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that bhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion, one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the bhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as is clearly stated. So bhakti or devotional service is eternal. One should be established in that philosophical conviction, otherwise it is only a waste of time, ignorance.

That is perfection of knowledge. Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground floor up to the top floor. Now on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second or third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the understanding of Kåñëa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone wants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without humility understanding is harmful. To think oneself God is most puffed up. Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, still he thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance. One should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature. One must know and be convinced of this truth.

He has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities. Now He is explaining the knowable, both the soul and the Supersoul respectively. By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which the jéva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of jévätmä’s manifestation from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature confirms this: na jäyate måjayate vä vipaçcit. The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of knowledge. The Supreme Lord is also stated in the Vedic literature as pradhäna-kñetrajïa-patir guëeçaù. The Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is the chief knower of the body, and He is the master of the three modes of material nature. In the småti it is said: däsa- bhüto harer eva nänyasvaiva kadäcana. The living entities are eternally in the service of the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teaching; therefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity, it is to be understood that he is vijïänaà brahma as opposed to ananta-brahma. Ananta-brahma is the Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead.

Actually, the individual souls have spiritual senses, but in condemned life they are covered with the material elements and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter. The Supreme Lord’s senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are therefore called nirguëa. Guëa means the material modes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensual activities, He has His transcendental senses which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the Çvetäçvatara Upaniñad in the verse: sarvataù päëi-pädam. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated, but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but He has eyes —otherwise how could He see? He sees everything, past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in the future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gétä: He knows everything, but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature. Bhagavad-gétä also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by His internal potency.

Both of them existed before this cosmos was manifested. Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mahä- Visëu, and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of mahat- tattva.

It really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact with material nature.

It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum total—body and instrument senses—are offered by material nature, and, as will be clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one’s desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the 1iving entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body. This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas as follows: dvä suparëä sayujä sakhäyä. The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul or Paramätmä.

TRANSLATION The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species. PURPORT This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature.

One has to rise, therefore, above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position. That is called Kåñëa consciousness.

There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them as a friend. The fact is that individual living entities are eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and act independantly in an attempt to dominate the supreme nature, and because he has this tendency, he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The living entity can be situated either in the material energy or the spiritual energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord, as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy, but due to his minute independence, the individual entity is continually rejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives instructions as stated in Bhagavad-gétä, and from within He tries to convince him that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real happiness.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"b9ced598-6bb7-4a3a-bf13-07a412a2db48":{"id_":"b9ced598-6bb7-4a3a-bf13-07a412a2db48","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"83180295-d9e5-46d9-ad23-08c185e164ec","metadata":{},"hash":"eD5d7AYHYgtGgNcEAmNto25kKxuTst5MNsXQpRNccb0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"45abbb46-56db-4826-9cd2-c18688e11f50","metadata":{},"hash":"JZCGrBv7RiB5rB9zSVcqM+R7i2frfp01SjHrsWGUyww="}},"hash":"PCm34PIotEjjLGOXTajcvpyYFJIFN+hOY+ovQG/IfXs=","text":"conducive to real happiness. “Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me.

This is the result of knowledge. The purpose of knowledge is to understand distinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into this material existence.

PURPORT This verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern society there is practically no education in spiritual matters. Some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached Kåñëa consciousness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources, he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps, he will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse particularly the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home.

Thus he cannot be destroyed. By nature he is full of bliss. He does not engage himself in any material activities; therefore the activities performed due to his contact with material bodies do not entangle him.

TRANSLATION O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does the living entity, one within the body, illuminate the entire body by consciousness. PURPORT There are various theories regarding consciousness. Here in Bhagavad-gétä the example of the sun and the sunshine is given. As the sun is situated in one place, but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of spirit soul, although situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole body by consciousness. Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the soul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun. When the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the body, and as soon as the soul has passed from the body, there is no more consciousness. This can be easily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore consciousness is not a production of the combinations of matter. It is the symptom of the living entity. The consciousness of the living entity, although qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme because the consciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body. But the Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual soul, is conscious of all bodies. That is the difference between supreme consciousness and individual consciousness.

TRANSLATION One who knowingly sees this difference between the body and the owner of the body and can understand the process of liberation from this bondage, also attains to the supreme goal. PURPORT The purport of this Thirteenth Chapter is that one should know the distinction between the body, the owner of the body, and the Supersoul. A faithful person should at first have some good association to hear of God and thus gradually become enlightened. If one accepts a spiritual master, he can learn to distinguish between matter and spirit, and that becomes the steppingstone for further spiritual realization. A spiritual master teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life by various instructions. For instance, in Bhagavad-gétä we find Kåñëa instructing Arjuna to free him from materialistic considerations. One can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its twenty-four elements. That is the gross manifestation. And the subtle manifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life are the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is the soul, and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four material elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and also can see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the spiritual world. These things are meant for contemplation and for realization, and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of the spiritual master. Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Thirteenth Chapter of the Çrémad-Bhagavad-gétä in the matter of Nature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness.

PURPORT This is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to the combination of kñetra and kñetrajïa, the body and the spirit soul. This combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the Supreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic manifestation, and because in the total substance of the material cause there are three modes of nature, it is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme Personality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes become possible. This total material substance, the mahat-tattva, is described as Brahman in the Vedic literature: tasmäd etad brahma näma-rüpam annaà ca jäyate. Into that Brahman the seeds of the living entities are impregnated by the Supreme Person. The twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, fire and air, are all material energy, called Mahä-brahman, or the great Brahman, the material nature. As is explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is another, superior nature—the living entity. In material nature the superior nature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature. The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the scorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion. Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not the cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material nature. Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a different body, created by this material nature, and the entity can enjoy or suffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the cause of all the manifestations of living entities in this material world.

The living entities are combinations of the material nature and the spiritual nature. Such living entities are seen not only on this planet, but in every planet, even in the highest where Brahmä is situated. Everywhere there are living entities; within the earth there are living entities, even within water and within fire. All these appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and Kåñëa’s seed-giving process.

One is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities’ conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of Bhagavad-gétä. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is the brähmaëa, who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness. The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness, he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are the scientist and philosopher: each is very proud of his knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly, one may become a philosopher, a scientist, or a poet, and, repeatedly, become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death. But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant.

PURPORT The mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman. Woman has attraction for man, and man has attraction for woman. This is called the mode of passion. And, when the mode of passion is increased, one develops the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife, and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work. Therefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standards of the mode of passion. Formerly, the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness.

In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can understand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite. Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic literature: under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand the thing as it is. For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died, and therefore he will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure.

Similarly, activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated.

Animal life is always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, mäyä, the animals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is the son of the Supreme Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant’s being killed. One has to pay for it. So, indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals because God has supplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature the words gobhiù préëita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is desirous of killing the cow, is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that states: namo brahmaëya-deväya go-brähmaëa-hitäya ca jagaddhitäya kåñëäya govindäya namo namaù. “My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the brähmaëas, and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world.” The purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the brähmaëas.

In the mode of passion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no limit. One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangement for sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of mind. That is not possible because one is situated in the mode of passion. If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him; he has to elevate himself to the mode of goodness by practicing Kåñëa consciousness.

He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough money to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of ignorance, people become mad.

There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the heavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree of development of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to various planets in this system. The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka, where the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahmä, resides. We have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring us to this. The mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of goodness and ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich man. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this earth, in the modes of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of becoming mad in the next life.

Similarly, it is from those who are fully in Kåñëa consciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature. Otherwise, one’s life will be misdirected. By the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his material body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the material modes of nature. He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes, but when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental platform, having the scope for spiritual life. Actually, the living entity is not the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material nature. Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in what position he is actually situated. With the association of a bona fide spiritual master, he can see his real position, and, by such an understanding, he can become fixed in full Kåñëa consciousness. A man in Kåñëa consciousness is not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It has already been stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to Kåñëa is relieved from the activities of material nature. Therefore for one who is able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually ceases.

He first inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person. How can one understand that he has already transcended the influence of the modes of material nature? The second question asks how he lives and what his activities are. Are they regulated or nonregulated? Then Arjuna inquires of the means by which he can attain the transcendental nature.

In these verses, Kåñëa first indicates that a person transcendentally situated neither envies anyone nor hankers for anything. When a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature.

The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by such false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in Kåñëa consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He accepts things that are favorable for his duty in Kåñëa consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or gold. He takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of Kåñëa consciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material existence. Social and political issues do not affect him because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attempt anything for Kåñëa, but for his personal self he does not attain anything. By such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated.

As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to Kåñëa activities. Kåñëa activities are known as bhakti-yoga—always acting for Kåñëa. This includes not only Kåñëa, but His different plenary expansions such as Räma and Näräyaëa. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of Kåñëa, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of Kåñëa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of Kåñëa or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily. This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto Kåñëa at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"06e8853d-e9bd-40dc-b422-9c5c8437d4a7":{"id_":"06e8853d-e9bd-40dc-b422-9c5c8437d4a7","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2e614121-a1d5-423f-a45a-be080324d17b","metadata":{},"hash":"zx8Xk2WyaSUQgRleqqd1K//3Nxza4skXYGLBvkqs9m0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8f246189-44f0-44d3-a026-a4b0f472593a","metadata":{},"hash":"AQqCKKrH9ac0z8G7P6F2q+VopVWOawNA0OOFamU4KzU="}},"hash":"hVqo2LBPx5bntfkrJ8VC/AQRYF321nSea9sPuKEZwrY=","text":"material nature. To be in Kåñëa consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of Kåñëa. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity’s spiritual position is as good as gold, as good as Kåñëa in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no question of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there is no meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature: brahmaiva san brahmäpyeti. One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as individual soul.

PURPORT The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, and happiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. Paramätmä, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Paramätmä and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior material nature with the fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this stage the Brahman realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Paramätmä realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kumäras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling down.

Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said: raso vai saù; rasaà hy eväyaà labdhvänandé bhavati. “When one understands the Personality of God, the reservoir of pleasure, Kåñëa, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful.” The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him, there is an exchange of these six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so, eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, eternal life accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service. The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature, goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By engagement in devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering―the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service―should be practiced in the association of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one’s material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord’s transcendental loving service.

TRANSLATION The Blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas. PURPORT After the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may question, “What about the Vedas?” It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic study is to understand Kåñëa. Therefore one who is in Kåñëa consciousness, who is engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas. The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree. For one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree. He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree of this material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no possibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are called the leaves of this tree. This tree’s roots grow upward because they begin from where Brahmä is located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it. This process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the material entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. The root of this material existence grows upward. This means that it begins from the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities’ activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"9429c03d-ed24-4743-8e64-885a4961b45d":{"id_":"9429c03d-ed24-4743-8e64-885a4961b45d","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"87ef5c0e-d0c6-48bd-9a66-27c39c874a27","metadata":{},"hash":"lbRltdjlvG9ZFw0WSqGxjOwvhT8w03PjNUmeP9Z0lXY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"16f806b7-7f2f-476f-9e89-e526e2b28fd3","metadata":{},"hash":"CcUl4jvBd4moMlN7SuVpCzc0ooqOy4qP8Avop/fnEDA="}},"hash":"BgPgP/YmcJJyExIHO3KslxyIYVBs0QPr4AVfxWJLq5k=","text":"gratification and liberation. Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be found beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect upon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the tree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual world. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as the tree’s reflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things’ being situated in this reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then he can cut off his relationship with it. This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica. Everything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahmä to be the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to säìkhya philosophy, come prakåti, puruña, then the three guëas, then the five gross elements (païca- mahäbhüta), then the ten senses (daçendriya), mind, etc. In this way they divide up the whole material world. If Brahmä is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180 degrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world.

The prakåti is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the puruña is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in Bhagavad-gétä. Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal.

The source of the senses―the ears, the nose, eyes, etc.―is considered to be the upper twigs, tuned to the enjoyment of different sense objects. The leaves are sound, form, touch―the sense objects. The roots, which are subsidiary, are the by-products of different varieties of suffering and sense enjoyment. Thus we develop attachment and aversion.

So doing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything has begun and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial. PURPORT It is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot be understood in this material world. Since the root is upwards, the extension of the real tree is at the other end. No one can see how far the tree extends, nor can one see the beginning of this tree. Yet one has to find out the cause. “I am the son of my father, my father is the son of such and such a person, etc.” By searching in this way, one comes to Brahmä, who is generated by the Garbhodakaçäyé Viñëu. Finally, in this way, when one reaches to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that is the end of research work. One has to search out that origin of this tree, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, through the association of persons who are in the knowledge of that Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false reflection of reality, and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and actually become situated in the real tree. The word asaìga is very important in this connection because the attachment for sense enjoyment and lording it over the material nature is very strong. Therefore one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on authoritative scriptures, and one must hear from persons who are actually in knowledge. As a result of such discussion in the association of devotees, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the first thing one must do is surrender to Him. The description of that place whence going no one returns to this false reflected tree is given here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, is the original root from whom everything has emanated. To gain favor of that Personality of Godhead, one has only to surrender, and this is a result of performing devotional service by hearing, chanting, etc. He is the cause of this extension of this material world.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"4c583706-7628-4591-909c-fea865db7439":{"id_":"4c583706-7628-4591-909c-fea865db7439","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"50cad39d-7174-4b4a-9735-e0544f1c273f","metadata":{},"hash":"zvX1EJrTHQB93qe38w9OHgNzPRjv010nvRniV42+3OU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a1d9f6b0-e93a-4838-b0e4-7c870a3659f4","metadata":{},"hash":"QBXQj4UPl7BnNV6XXpdGlhb4BQAtHDz/sBTDW4uorPg="}},"hash":"zQKRj5bUT1c9sWnyp0Xf9J+rc1jMmPWwxHqkqXN8ZzE=","text":"He is the cause of this extension of this material world.

When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering that the land, this earth, belongs to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social, and national affections. These fake associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And, when one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

In the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity, because all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this universe, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual sky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called Vaikuëöhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti. Actually, the effulgence is emanating from the planet of Kåñëa, Goloka Våndävana. Part of that shining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material world. Other than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets, which are called Vaikuëöhas, chief of which is Goloka Våndävana. As long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky, by cutting through the false, perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no chance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes the associate of the Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"9c07a2e0-baf8-480d-996b-7e95f3479f3f":{"id_":"9c07a2e0-baf8-480d-996b-7e95f3479f3f","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5edde3c0-824d-4177-9c33-12e55e63e999","metadata":{},"hash":"pHD887ozl8Yb8J3YbPovNcKWXwarRkR+TsL4fLeHO58="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c28f3f5d-d2f0-4e13-84ce-1ffb15d8e358","metadata":{},"hash":"w0ZAk6KzXVw5d7LkCowYquQaADx1Xy/HJFWdMMh323M="}},"hash":"+GhCBib1axGPEZ124JqmVN6ZT6YaTcmgDz5MryGE79A=","text":"Lord.

One has to associate himself with devotees, those who are in Kåñëa consciousness. One should search out a society dedicated to Kåñëa consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is described as purely transcendental. The words paramaà mama are very important here. Actually every nook and corner is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is paramam, full of six opulences. In the Upaniñads it is also confirmed that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine or moonshine, for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. That supreme abode can be achieved only by surrender and by no other means.

It is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is clearly said, sanätanaù. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary expansions are called Viñëu-tattva, and the secondary expansions are called the living entities. In other words, the Viñëu-tattva is the personal expansion, and the living entities are separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord Räma, Nåsiàhadeva, Viñëumürti and all the predominating Deities in the Vaikuëöha planets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities have also fragmental qualities, of which independence is one.

As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world. The living entities, not only the human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater controllers of the material world―Brahmä, Lord Çiva, and even Viñëu―are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord.

He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests in its individual capacity.

The word mamaiväàçaù (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is also very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some material broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It is not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That conception is not applicable here because the Sanskrit word sanätana (eternal) is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that (dehino ’smin yathä) in each and every individual body, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present. That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one, just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.

PURPORT Here the living entity is described as éçvara, the controller of his own body. If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body undergoes depends upon him. At the time of death, the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat’s or dog’s body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly qualities, he will change into the form of a demigod. And, if he is in Kåñëa consciousness, he will be transferred to Kåñëaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with Kåñëa. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called karñati or struggle for existence.

Without knowledge, one cannot understand how a living entity leaves his present body, nor what form of body he is going to take in the next life, nor even why he is living in a particular type of body. This requires a great amount of knowledge understood from Bhagavad-gétä and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master. One who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every living entity is quitting his body under certain circumstances; he is living under certain circumstances and enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell of material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power of understanding their change of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it. Those who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the spirit is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different ways.

From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there are different suns, moons and planets also. Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun, the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their foodstuff; they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done with the help of fire.

So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa, then one’s Kåñëa consciousness will begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kåñëa.

PURPORT It is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy of the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and every living being. That is discussed in the Brahmä-saàhitä. It is said there that one plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramätmä, enters into the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead, it sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust falling, but if one throws it in the air, it will fall down. Similarly, these planets, which are floating in air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and unmoving things stay in their place. It is said that because of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not for Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"bfdc9cd8-2d21-4085-af3d-f65f2889198e":{"id_":"bfdc9cd8-2d21-4085-af3d-f65f2889198e","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4871832c-a0b9-416c-8b7a-407e05afcff4","metadata":{},"hash":"EzYQMRK69qKqqG7cVjFzIKaOICfh0kndD2j8gvJnCDM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"62b9f24f-1b7d-4d03-b5cd-198f605dedf1","metadata":{},"hash":"QfXUv7bUdJjzxpn+RT1F6+hCJZ4rKfNEnFEEZB7PWJU="}},"hash":"hBJTYFWKo7W7G4NqYcghRJO6TzDvRTl23a91/PaUJ8o=","text":"is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables.

If one is serious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then Kåñëa gives the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand Kåñëa. Vedic literature confirms this: yo ’sau sarvair vedair géyate. In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four Vedas, Vedänta-sütra and the Upaniñads and Puräëas, the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the Vedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Kåñëa. The Vedas give us direction to understand Kåñëa and the process of understanding. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedänta-sütra confirms this in the following words: tat tu samanvayät. One can attain perfection by understanding Vedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing the different processes.

Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the Vedänta-sütra: He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be divided into two classes—the fallible and the infallible. The living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When they are in contact with the material world, they are called jéva-bhütäù, and the Sanskrit words given here, sarväëi bhütäni mean that they are fallible. Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but that there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as creation, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has stated in the Vedänta-sütra that He is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.

The living entities, who are struggling in this world with the mind and five senses, have their material bodies which are changing as long as the living entities are conditioned. One’s body changes due to contact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes―birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the changes of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all exists in oneness. It is more clearly explained as sarväëi bhütäni: any living entity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created being, Brahmä, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all fallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.

It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities, some of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, there is the Supreme Personality who is Paramätmä. The Upanisadic verse runs as follows: nityo nityänäà cetanaç cetanänäm. The purport is that amongst all the living entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and gives them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone’s heart as Paramätmä. A wise man who can understand Him is eligible to attain the perfect peace, not others. It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on the same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question of superiority and inferiority in their personalities. This particular word uttama is very significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Loke is also significant because in the Pauruña, a Vedic literature, it is stated: lokyate vedärtho ’nena. This Supreme Lord in His localized aspect as Paramätmä explains the purpose of the Vedas. The following verse also appears in the Vedas: tävad eña samprasädo ’smäc charérät samutthäya paraà jyoti-rüpaà sampadya svena rüpeëäbhiniñpadyate sa uttamaù puruñaù “The Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahmajyoti; then in His form He remains in His spiritual identity. That Supreme is called the Supreme Personality.” This means that the Supreme Personality is exhibiting and diffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That Supreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Paramätmä. By incarnating Himself as the son of Satyavaté and Paräçara, He explains the Vedic knowledge as Vyäsadeva.

Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-gétä, this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn commentators on Bhagavad-gétä who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same. Vedic knowledge is called çruti learning by aural reception. One should actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like Kåñëa and His representatives. Here Kåñëa distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad- gétä that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas. The word bhajate is very significant. In many places the word bhajate is expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"6edb00a7-d64e-415e-9c35-1d0fca76e632":{"id_":"6edb00a7-d64e-415e-9c35-1d0fca76e632","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9a265e92-1c6c-45a7-9f51-e277f12a8dc8","metadata":{},"hash":"gQwcxTmgRgi4Ryl5iNCzUPXqbQKPMU4uDpmLNPgF/Ds="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"60908ebc-b34a-4c77-94f8-b72e8c5828f3","metadata":{},"hash":"nsvKuBI+N74wl34xBx8I6I/jBKbFE6kknvGtXP0T2PQ="}},"hash":"mjX/UwDs4dxUz5kU4fqMIbyhWN6BwA4VFCYeK9oiq+M=","text":"expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord.

Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in transcendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philosophy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. Wherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist. Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are spiritual—the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the sun, and ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance. Everyone must take to this consciousness of Kåñëa and engage in devotional service to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of understanding Kåñëa and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent. The word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha, O sinless one, means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions, it is very difficult to understand Kåñëa. One has to become free from all contamination, all sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness. While performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full Kåñëa consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished altogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the heart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord. The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity of lording it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the possession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these weaknesses of the heart.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"7383e649-2057-43c5-a3d0-75878718912f":{"id_":"7383e649-2057-43c5-a3d0-75878718912f","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"60908ebc-b34a-4c77-94f8-b72e8c5828f3","metadata":{},"hash":"nsvKuBI+N74wl34xBx8I6I/jBKbFE6kknvGtXP0T2PQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3bdc8d87-cfdc-4ff8-8407-52f7d5a3d530","metadata":{},"hash":"wCotIeWVwmFMMjLVdPTdqpmHsdiRirqhruqerpNnzeo="}},"hash":"jPweL/XftlnPO05+nhnafAL3GTvMW1hGWMjRxGCMMB0=","text":"matter.

For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well as the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities. The word abhijätasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhädhäna-saàskära. If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human being. In Bhagavad-gétä we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is Kåñëa Himself. Sex life is not condemned provided the process is used in Kåñëa consciousness. Those who are in Kåñëa consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may become Kåñëa conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father or mother absorbed in Kåñëa consciousness. The social institution known as varëäçrama-dharma―the institution dividing society into four divisions or castes―is not meant to divide human society according to birth.

A brähmaëa is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the kñatriyas, the vaiçyas and the çüdras, but a sannyäsé, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the brähmaëas also. For a sannyäsé, the first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sannyäsé has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks, “After leaving my connections, who will protect me?” he should not accept the renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that Kåñëa or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Paramätmä is always within, that He is seeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm conviction that Kåñëa as Paramätmä will take care of a soul surrendered to Him. “I shall never be alone,” one should think. “Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kåñëa, and He will give me all protection.” That conviction is called abhayam, without fear. This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sannyäsé is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sannyäsé, and when He was at Puré His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place.

One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyäsé, intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sannyäsé was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sannyäsa order of the life in connection with association with woman. One of His personal associates, namely Choöa Haridäsa, was personally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Choöa Haridäsa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, “For a sannyäsé or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification―not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity―is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.” So these are the processes for purification. The next item is jïäna-yoga-vyavasthitiù: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. Sannyäsé life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A sannyäsé is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sannyäsé goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to Kåñëa consciousness.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"6f9ecf5a-779d-42e2-bbb8-a49263ae8820":{"id_":"6f9ecf5a-779d-42e2-bbb8-a49263ae8820","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"062f9798-ad84-4a55-83c5-478994ff1fc8","metadata":{},"hash":"q/dHZe1yUywIyzxTe8L99IARhV8hFYqYMwRa/Azy5sE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"bff96680-d016-4bad-a10f-287485300f94","metadata":{},"hash":"lNyuIoDUCOn7LPFEJFJ6lxiLt2rkfCf9PcDhVsKV2iY="}},"hash":"jXoSvDjkxilhvFCjnUKbGz6gu6W2f002DqsHKdL2nt0=","text":"begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to Kåñëa consciousness. This is the duty of a sannyäsé. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach Kåñëa with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sannyäsé or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saàçuddhiù (purity) and jïäna-yoga (knowledge). The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate Kåñëa consciousness all over the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate Kåsna consciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness. Then as far as damaù (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder. Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality but is demoniac.

If he is able to beget children who will be in Kåñëa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure. Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices require a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the brahmacarya, the vänaprastha and sannyäsa, have no money; they live by begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called saìkértana-yajïa, the chanting of Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. This is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder. Then svädhyäyaù, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and ärjavam, gentleness or simplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life. Brahmacärés should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called svädhyäyaù. Tapas or austerity is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life, brahmacarya, gåhastha, vänaprastha and sannyäsa. So after gåhastha, householder life, one should retire.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"bebe0676-aea2-484b-85c9-d3b24c732e87":{"id_":"bebe0676-aea2-484b-85c9-d3b24c732e87","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bff96680-d016-4bad-a10f-287485300f94","metadata":{},"hash":"lNyuIoDUCOn7LPFEJFJ6lxiLt2rkfCf9PcDhVsKV2iY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1c572fc2-b18a-41f7-ac43-ff3cbef95d9d","metadata":{},"hash":"M3EkCJHP/2SUJHqQQcxZOhZ3tcdqNZ/cH4LCof9z2JM="}},"hash":"+0ZBEI13gJeZXTDH6ObAUkWOdurGwImS7xWhXaEy9TY=","text":"So after gåhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasyä. The entire varëäçrama-dharma society is meant for tapasyä. Without tapasyä or austerity no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither recommended in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad- gétä. Such theories are manufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don’t restrict the lives of their students nor their own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas. As far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmacarya-äçrama, or gåhastha-äçrama or vänaprastha-äçrama. One must live very simply. Ahiàsä means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice.

So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s palate. This is called ahiàsä. Satyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the process for understanding Vedas. Çruti means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gétä that misinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. Akrodhaù means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is the product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. Apaiçunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life.

Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally. One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness. As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the Manu-saàhitä, which is the law of the human race. Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-saàhitä. Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-saàhitä, it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social behavior according to the Manu-saàhitä. But modern education has artificially devised a puffed up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"fea18e56-7f4a-4aad-9bcf-a6a7eb6011b2":{"id_":"fea18e56-7f4a-4aad-9bcf-a6a7eb6011b2","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7edc593a-e939-4b7d-8e8b-c62b85ecc0ae","metadata":{},"hash":"yxZ+Cu/RWRdI40HLNMwM6ILJt1c/Jhy4BnzdBnf2LzU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"170bd9e9-a0fe-4277-b13c-168ea83b8476","metadata":{},"hash":"iBfzKa4RmaYAwRyFJIR3mXbvXzK8uUqMoqJWIVToPZA="}},"hash":"XFFou0HGK4VTQQET/pIhbxiDqGm8RCErpUkABDa0pvE=","text":"therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society.

The materialists, who have no concept of God, think that they are advancing. But, according to Bhagavad-gétä, they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense.

They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world.

Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong way. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God, create their own hymns and chant accordingly. The result is that they become more and more attracted to two things—sex enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth. The word açuci-vratäù, unclean vow, is very significant in this connection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and meat eating; those are their açuci, unclean habits. Induced by pride and false prestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the Vedic injunctions. Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world, still, by artificial means, the world creates a false honor for them. Although they are gliding toward hell, they consider themselves very much advanced.

The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul.

He is given an opportunity to accumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma. According to the law of karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac thinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of his personal ability. He does not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people, beauty, and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep—between persons, then between families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world. Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others. Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a demoniac preacher tells his followers: “Why are you seeking God elsewhere? You are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don’t believe in God. Throw away God. God is dead.” These are the demoniac’s preachings. Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one is more influential than him.

In answer to this question, in the Vedänta-sütra we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred for anyone. The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest status of life is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are killed by the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are instances in history of many asuras—Rävaëa, Kaàsa, Hiraëyakaçipu—to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill.

Everyone is expected to follow these rules and regulations. If one does not follow them and acts whimsically according to his lust, greed and desire, then he never will be perfect in his life.

Therefore one should gradually raise himself to the platform of Kåñëa consciousness and devotional service; it is then and there that he can attain the highest perfectional stage, not otherwise. The word käma-cärataù is very significant. A person who knowingly violates the rules acts in lust. He knows that this is forbidden, still he acts. This is called acting whimsically. He knows that this should be done, but still he does not do it; therefore he is called whimsical. Such persons are destined to be condemned by the Supreme Lord. Such persons cannot have the perfection which is meant for the human life. The human life is especially meant for purifying one’s existence, and one who does not follow the rules and regulations cannot purify himself, nor can he attain the real stage of happiness.

Lord Caitanya Mahäprabhu made this process very easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare Kåñëa, Hare Kåñëa, Kåñëa Kåñëa, Hare Hare/ Hare Räma, Hare Räma, Räma Räma, Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not in Krsëa consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas. One should act accordingly, without argument.

Çästra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the çästra—being above these defects—are accepted without alteration by all great saints, äcäryas, and great souls. In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the çästras is considered fortunate. In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest offense of human life. Therefore, mäyä, the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures.

The living being is said to be of a particular faith according to the modes he has acquired. PURPORT Everyone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of life, still, originally, he is nirguëa, or transcendental. Therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without fear: Kåñëa consciousness. If one is situated in Kåñëa consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature. The word sattva, or faith, is very significant in this verse. Sattva or faith always comes out of the works of goodness. One’s faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. It is supposed to be one’s strong faith in something that is productive of the works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works of material nature are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one’s faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"2cf3fe62-3593-4bf7-a78c-c44b5718ee71":{"id_":"2cf3fe62-3593-4bf7-a78c-c44b5718ee71","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"576e27b9-09b5-4a0f-adf7-19ff270eb9ef","metadata":{},"hash":"GoybtgZ9GZNO08nFU9YRTCGrHIwOCHJrlygad+78LjY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"cf4c8936-7fd8-4bed-a24f-c4e78623e3b8","metadata":{},"hash":"SoDxatp41qjM8AR/p84rmMczhQ4puapJIAfFUWuiMiM="}},"hash":"jOE30lclItU6hKP2f9vVhawLLTcJCdPpAW8hAQx9m1c=","text":"purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature.

Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted, we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship.

According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods. The demigods include Brahmä, Çiva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War, a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained. Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have seen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is said, sattvaà viçuddham väsudeva-çabditam. “When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships Väsudeva.” The purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature.

Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food cooked more than three hours before being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean, is food liked by people in the mode of ignorance. PURPORT Thc purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life’s duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split peas, dhall, whole wheat, etc. Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by producing mucous in the stomach, leading to disease.

Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten (except prasädam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness. Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially the spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs, although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnant of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gétä the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. Patraà puñpaà phalaà toyam. Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But it is also mentioned that the prasädam should be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunction of the scripture offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental. Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one should offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Take, for example, the performance of rituals in temples or in churches. Generally they are performed with the purpose of material benefit, but that is not in the mode of goodness. One should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer flowers and eatables. Everyone thinks that there is no use in going to the temple just to worship God. But worship for economic benefit is not recommended in the scriptural injunction. One should go simply to offer respect to the Deity. That will place one in the mode of goodness. It is the duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures and offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Sometimes people worship some demigod just to make money and then spend the money for recreation, ignoring the scriptural injunctions. Such ceremonial shows of religiosity are not accepted as genuine. They are all in the mode of darkness; they produce a demoniac mentality and do not benefit human society.

Cleanliness, simplicity, celibacy and nonviolence are also austerities of the body. PURPORT The Supreme Godhead here explains the different kinds of austerity and penance. First He explains the austerities and penances practiced by the body. One should offer, or learn to offer, respect to God or to the demigods, the perfect, qualified brähmaëas and the spiritual master and superiors like father, mother or any person who is conversant with Vedic knowledge. These should be given proper respect. One should practice cleansing oneself externally and internally, and he should learn to become simple in behavior. He should not do anything which is not sanctioned by the scriptural injunction. He should not indulge in sex outside of married life, for sex is sanctioned in the scripture only in marriage, not otherwise. This is called celibacy. These are penances and austerities as far as the body is concerned.

Of course, when a teacher speaks, he can speak the truth for the instruction of his students, but such a teacher should not speak to others who are not his students if he will agitate their minds. This is penance as far as talking is concerned. Besides that, one should not talk nonsense. When speaking in spiritual circles, one’s statements must be upheld by the scriptures. One should at once quote from scriptural authority to back up what he is saying. At the same time, such talk should be very pleasurable to the ear. By such discussions, one may derive the highest benefit and elevate human society. There is a limitless stock of Vedic literature, and one should study this. This is called penance of speech.

TRANSLATION And serenity, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purity of thought are the austerities of the mind. PURPORT To make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification. It should be so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others. The best training for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from Kåñëa consciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one’s nature is to become Kåñëa conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think of sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind’s becoming satisfied. The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying stories, as in the Puräëas and the Mahäbhärata. One can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means that one is always thinking of self-realization. The person in Kåñëa consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be straightforward in his dealing and thereby purify his existence. All these qualities together constitute austerity in mental activities.

Therefore charity is recommended to be given at a place of pilgrimage and at lunar or solar eclipses or at the end of the month or to a qualified brähmaëa or a Vaiñëava (devotee) or in temples. Such charities should be given without any consideration of return. Charity to the poor is sometimes given out of compassion, but if a poor man is not worth giving charity to, then there is no spiritual advancement. In other words, indiscriminate charity is not recommended in the Vedic literature.

These kinds of charity are said to be made in the mode of passion. There are many charitable foundations which offer their gifts to institutions where sense gratification goes on. Such charities are not recommended in the Vedic scripture. Only charity in the mode of goodness is recommended.

When they are aimed at the Supreme—om tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal—they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words, om tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word om is always found. One who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charities, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the modes of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words om tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., om tad viñëoù. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered, om is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. Om ity etad brahmaëo nediñöaà näma indicates the first goal. Then tattvamasi indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya indicates the third goal. Combined they become om tat sat. Formerly when Brahmä, the first created living entity, performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same principle holds by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-gétä recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Krñna consciousness. Kåñëa consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way.

Such purificatory processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living entity. In all such activities it is recommended that one should vibrate om tat sat. The words sad-bhäve and sädhu-bhäve indicate the transcendental situation. One who is acting in Kåñëa consciousness is called sattva, and one who is fully conscious of activities in Kåñëa consciousness is called svarüpa. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam it is said that the transcendental subject matter becomes clear in the association of the devotees. Without good association, one cannot achieve transcendental knowledge. When initiating a person or offering the sacred thread, one vibrates the words om tat sat. Similarly, in all kinds of yogic performances, the supreme object, om tat sat is invoked. These words om tat sat are used to perfect all activities. This supreme om tat sat makes everything complete.

Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the understanding of Kåñëa. No one can obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in Kåñëa consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is the way to make everything successful. In the conditional state, people are attracted to worship demigods, ghosts, or Yakñas like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to Kåñëa consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to Kåñëa consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter.

In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service: yoginäm api sarveñäm... “Of all yogés or transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best.” In the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, summarized by the words om tat sat, which indicate Viñëu, the Supreme Person. In the third part of Bhagavad-gétä, devotional service was established by the example of past äcäryas and the Brahma-sütra, the Vedänta-sütra, which cites that devotional service is the ultimate purpose of life and nothing else. Certain impersonalists consider themselves monopolizers of the knowledge of Vedänta-sütra, but actually the Vedänta-sütra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Vedänta-sütra, and He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every Veda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-gétä. As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described, similarly, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad- gétä, namely renunciation (tyäga) and the renounced order of life (sannyäsa). Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words.

However, sacrifice for the purification of one’s heart or for advancement in the spiritual science should not be given up.

For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacrifice, yet some maintain animal killing is completely abominable. Although animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"87698e69-ea3c-4ae7-a96d-8253c6c873d3":{"id_":"87698e69-ea3c-4ae7-a96d-8253c6c873d3","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8453c11b-faf5-437b-9741-1d6483482ad1","metadata":{},"hash":"htveBgYt+cdxQwQl/6IudAz57+7TZHUm6dnhSJJP5t0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"61462e99-239d-424e-854e-dde9026994a4","metadata":{},"hash":"dQVwEyc7y0PnUl5W+bCVPnhyDsCScdHQwmNdQelrXzw="}},"hash":"jXUf+tOLSiby5iJ1sImH7uz+69wVBc+m10UMuyacbJA=","text":"sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life.

PURPORT The yogés should perform acts for the advancement of human society. There are many purificatory processes for advancing a human being to spiritual life. The marriage ceremony, for example, is considered to be one of these sacrifices. It is called viväha-yajïa. Should a sannyäsé, who is in the renounced order of life and who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage ceremony? The Lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never be given up. Viväha-yajïa, the marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human mind to become peaceful for spiritual advancement. For most men, this viväha-yajïa should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life. Sannyasés should never associate with women, but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony. All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up. Similarly, charity is for the purification of the heart. If charity is given to suitable persons, as described previously, it leads one to advanced spiritual life.

TRANSLATION O mighty-armed Arjuna, learn from Me of the five factors which bring about the accomplishment of all action. These are declared in säìkhya philosophy to be the place of action, the performer, the senses, the endeavor, and ultimately the Supersoul. PURPORT A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some reaction, how is it that the person in Kåñëa consciousness does not suffer or enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing Vedänta philosophy to show how this is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities and for success in all activity, and one should know these five causes. Säìkhya means the stalk of knowledge, and Vedänta is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by all leading äcäryas. Even Çaìkara accepts Vedänta-sütra as such. Therefore such authority should be consulted. The ultimate will is invested in the Supersoul, as it is stated in the Gétä, “sarvasya cähaà hådi.” He is engaging everyone in certain activities. Acts done under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the life after death. The instruments of action are the senses, and by senses the soul acts in various ways, and for each and every action there is a different endeavor.

He is not concerned about acting in terms of the directions of scripture. For him God is money, and knowledge means the satisfaction of bodily demands.

Such a person has no desire for higher elevation of life. He is simply concerned with making this world as materially comfortable as possible.

That which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness. PURPORT A conditioned soul tries to enjoy material happiness again and again. Thus he chews the chewed, but, sometimes, in the course of such enjoyment, he becomes relieved from material entanglement by association with a great soul. In other words, a conditioned soul is always engaged in some type of sense gratification, but when he understands by good association that it is only a repetition of the same thing, and he is awakened to his real Kåñëa consciousness, he is sometimes relieved from such repetitive so-called happiness. In the pursuit of self-realization, one has to follow many rules and regulations to control the mind and the senses and to concentrate the mind on the Self. All these procedures are very difficult, bitter like poison, but if one is successful in following the regulations and comes to the transcendental position, he begins to drink real nectar, and he enjoys life.

This is confirmed in the Vedänta-sütra—janmädy asya yataù. The Supreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies.

The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of His plenary portion as Paramätmä is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord it is his duty to render service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in full Kåñëa consciousness. That is recommended in this verse. Everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by Håñékeça, the master of the senses. And, by the result of the work in which one is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Çré Kåñëa, should be worshiped. If one thinks always in this way, in full Kåñëa consciousness, then, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection of life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gétä, teñäm ahaà samuddhartä. The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee. That is the highest perfection of life.

Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a kñatriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a brähmaëa. One should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a kñatriya. He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is performed for the sake of Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there can be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, “Oh, my dear customer, for you I am making no profit,” but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a brähmaëa. That is not recommended. Whether one is a kñatriya, a vaiçya, or a çüdra doesn’t matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even brähmaëas, who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a kñatriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of yajïa, or for Viñëu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"ae3cb1de-9d1c-4f52-ac36-122908841325":{"id_":"ae3cb1de-9d1c-4f52-ac36-122908841325","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"25e7915b-7e93-40d6-8b6c-6c0c097746dc","metadata":{},"hash":"sdONXCfW8LoCtlMu0EnCFj+POvI5OEuQa6Q8Q41yueQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a983f8e9-68f0-4c9d-a37f-883903bd5c56","metadata":{},"hash":"CHFCFfm8RNV6wh2VlOA4h6/oGcXsxIvPNZfJus2dGOY="}},"hash":"XmYNaNt2Gj9vkbnYkXUQE+WWUZlSe0DxAq9b8blxRnM=","text":"should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord.

Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a çüdra serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done.

One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in Kåñëa consciousness. That is the perfectional point.

That is the highest perfectional stage of renunciation. PURPORT Real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore he has no right to enjoy the results of his work. Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually Krñna consciousness. The person acting in Kåñëa consciousness is really a sannyäsé, one in the renounced order of life. By such mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord. A sannyäsé is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in Kåñëa consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This state of mind is called yogärüòha, or the perfectional stage of yoga, as confirmed in the Third Chapter: yas tv ätma-ratir eva syät.

He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other than Kåñëa, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material loss or gain because he is full in service of the Lord. He has no desire for material enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value. This is the brahma-bhüta stage, and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one’s individuality becomes hellish, and the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like broken serpents’ teeth.

University degrees are not helpful. One who is fully conversant with the Kåñëa science becomes eligible to enter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of Kåñëa. Becoming Brahman does not mean that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as devotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of devotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation. Liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure Kåñëa consciousness. One should not misunderstand that the word viçate, “enters into Me,” supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal Brahman. No. Viçate means that one can enter into the abode of the Supreme Lord in his individuality to engage in His association and render service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living entities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths.

The Vedänta-sütra confirms this: äpräyaëät taträpi hi dåñöam. This means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues. In the Çrémad-Bhägavatam, real devotional liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already explained: every living entity is the part and parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After liberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life.

If one acts according to the direction of Kåñëa in this book, as well as under the guidance of the representative of Kåñëa, then the result will be the same. The Sanskrit word mat-paraù is very important in this verse. It indicates that one has no goal in life save and except acting in Kåñëa consciousness just to satisfy Kåñëa. And, while working in that way, one should think of Kåñëa only: “I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by Kåñëa.” While acting in such a way, one naturally has to think of Kåñëa. This is perfect Kåñëa consciousness. One should, however, note that, after doing something whimsically, he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of duty is not in the devotional service of Kåñëa consciousness. One should act according to the order of Krñna. This is a very important point. That order of Kåñëa comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master. Therefore the spiritual master’s order should be taken as the prime duty of life. If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then his perfection of life in Kåñëa consciousness is guaranteed.

He always looks after His friend’s comfort, and He gives Himself to His friend, who is so devotedly engaged working twenty-four hours a day to please the Lord. Therefore, no one should be carried away by the false ego of the bodily concept of life. One should not falsely think himself independant of the laws of material nature or free to act. He is already under strict material laws. But, as soon as he acts in Kåñëa consciousness, he is liberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very carefully that one who is not active in Kåñëa consciousness is losing himself in the material whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul actually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done, but a person who acts in Kåñëa consciousness is free to act because everything is prompted by Kåñëa from within and confirmed by the spiritual master.

He forgot that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present there, instructing him to fight. That is the forgetfulness of the conditioned soul. The Supreme Personality gives directions as to what is good and what is bad, and one simply has to act in Kåñëa consciousness to attain the perfection of life. No one can ascertain his destiny as the Supreme Lord can; therefore the best course is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and act. No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the order of the spiritual master who is the representative of God. One should act unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead—that will keep him safe under all circumstances.

PURPORT Arjuna was not the supreme knower, and his decision to fight or not to fight was confined to his limited discretion. Lord Kåñëa instructed that the individual is not all in all. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, Kåñëa, the localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living being. After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness of all his activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the material body which is created in the material energy under the direction of the Supersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he has to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a high-speed motor car goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the living entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the Supreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular type of living entity to work according to his past desires. The living entity is not independant. One should not think himself independant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The individual is always under His control. Therefore his duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction of the next verse.

TRANSLATION O scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly. By His grace you will attain transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode. PURPORT A living entity should therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is situated in everyone’s heart, and that will relieve him from all kinds of miseries of this material existence. By such surrender, one will not only be released from all miseries in this life, but at the end he will reach the Supreme God. The transcendental world is described in the Vedic literature as tad viñëoù paramaà padam. Since all of creation is the kingdom of God, everything material is actually spiritual, but paramaà padam specifically refers to the eternal abode, which is called the spiritual sky or Vaikuëöha. In the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gétä it is stated: “Sarvasya cäham hådi sanniviñöaù.” The Lord is seated in everyone’s heart, so this recommendation that one should surrender unto the Supersoul sitting within means that one should surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Kåñëa has already been accepted by Arjuna as the Supreme. He was accepted in the Tenth Chapter as paraà brahma paraà dhäma. Arjuna has accepted Kåñëa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the supreme abode of all living entities, not only because of his personal experience but also because of the evidences of great authorities like Närada, Asita, Devala and Vyäsa.

That is due to confidential knowledge. Kåñëa also discloses knowledge of the Supersoul. This is also Brahman knowledge, knowledge of Brahman, but it is superior. Here Lord Kåñëa telIs Arjuna that he can do as he chooses. God does not interfere with the little independence of the living entity. In Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living condition. The best advice imparted to Arjuna is to surrender unto the Supersoul seated within his heart. By right discrimination, one should agree to act according to the order of the Supersoul. That will help one become situated constantly in Kåñëa consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of human life. Arjuna is being directly ordered by the Personality of Godhead to fight.

PURPORT The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge, processes of religion, knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion. Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-gétä, the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to Kåñëa.

In the Eighth Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord Kåñëa. Thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to Çré Kåñëa he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept Kåñëa as the supreme savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him. According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of Kåñëa consciousness, all his activities are in vain. Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of Kåñëa consciousness should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances Kåñëa will protect him from all difficulties.

As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full Kåñëa consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature.

That simple surrender unto Kåñëa will save him from unnecessarily wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reaction. One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of Kåñëa. His name is Kåñëa because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all- powerful, omnipotent vision of Kåñëa is fortunate. There are different kinds of transcendentalists―some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Kåñëa Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional service to Kåñëa, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-gétä.

Actually the purpose of Bhagavad-gétä is not understandable to those who are sensuous—even if one is not sensuous but is strictly following the disciplines enjoined in the Vedic scripture, if he is not a devotee, he also cannot understand Kåñëa.

PURPORT The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for self- discipline. Çré Caitanya Mahäprabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord, he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity’s constitutional position is to be servitor; he either has to serve the illusory mäyä or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord, he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of mäyä to trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order. The word mohaù is very important in this verse. Mohaù refers to that which is opposed to knowledge. Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not servant, that he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That is his illusion.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"3151c9af-f319-496a-badf-f04188308408":{"id_":"3151c9af-f319-496a-badf-f04188308408","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0545def8-49b3-4edf-a64d-7f95d6eb7508","metadata":{},"hash":"6TC5bbH3RdcdLx1a4VNCKsOaRdP+iR9DKE25FJiIYrQ="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"0b0ff08f-f827-43cd-98fa-44cc440bfe60","metadata":{},"hash":"7sqcKCnG/aJ0pH7J9RsCS5+37iBS9iBUM2eYiWzI81s="}},"hash":"pHDKJv2MZGU8SLbdzCf8w6UlEK7xak5AZjV78ByPLKw=","text":"That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in Kåñëa consciousness. Kåñëa consciousness is acting according to Kåñëa’s order. A conditioned soul illusioned by the external energy of matter does not know that the Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of mäyä. Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-gétä from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could understand that Kåñëa was not only his friend, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood Kåñëa factually. So to study Bhagavad-gétä is to understand Kåñëa factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders to Kåñëa. When Arjuna understood that it was Kåñëa’s plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to Kåñëa’s desire. He again took up his weapons―his arrows and bow―to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

He thus explained the theme of the battlefield. The conversation was wonderful because such an important conversation between two great souls never took place before and would not take place again. It is wonderful because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is speaking about Himself and His energies to the living entity, Arjuna, a great devotee of the Lord. If we follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Kåñëa, then our life will be happy and successful. Saïjaya realized this, and as he began to understand it, he related the conversation to Dhåtaräñöra. Now it is concluded that wherever there is Kåñëa and Arjuna, there is victory.

He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But, after describing the scene in the battlefield, Saïjaya told the King, “You are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where Kåñëa and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.” He directly confirmed that Dhåtaräñöra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because Kåñëa was there. Kåñëa’s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. Kåñëa is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for Kåñëa is also the master of renunciation. The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhiñöhira. Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiñöhira. Because Kåñëa and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhiñöhira, Yudhiñöhira’s victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Saïjaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhiñöhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhiñöhira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because he was not only righteous and pious, but he was a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life. There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gétä to be a discussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that Kåñëa incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad- gétä is the supreme instruction in morality.

The instructions of Bhagavad-gétä constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the Gétä is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto Kåñëa. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter. From Bhagavad-gétä we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto Kåñëa is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-gétä. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are confidential, but one is still involved with meditation and cultivation of knowledge. Surrender unto Kåñëa in devotional service in full Kåñëa consciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter. Another feature of Bhagavad-gétä is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Absolute Truth is realized in three features―impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of Kåñëa. If one understands Kåñëa, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. Kåñëa is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of Kåñëa. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"8f6ebb4a-e1d3-469d-b320-35be5c7695e6":{"id_":"8f6ebb4a-e1d3-469d-b320-35be5c7695e6","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/bhagavad_gita_full.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"5M+Yf11hQlCfBCZsca7BxTOraIxHuhIx/UDazdAvnuo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d30ff4c6-11c9-4feb-98c6-8667e4706055","metadata":{},"hash":"P+Mg+Jte5cJM/CUvME3YxmerqbPn4q0vy+rtQ3VGIGo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"03f67076-3bd6-4602-87cd-1ea6330a4199","metadata":{},"hash":"TMLs9gx0BnTsgpGxSUpXURwUIhaLdG7D1flmxDcInGA="}},"hash":"Anj76G5+DvEAPeYdzlexAEjeZtzn+AO9q96C+paXbP8=","text":"This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible. In Bhagavad-gétä five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All of these are dependant on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kåñëa. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth, namely, impersonal Brahman, localized Paramätmä, or any other transcendental conception, exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya’s philosophy is that of “inconceivably one and different.” This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth. The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. The conditioned living entity, however, is the marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with both the material energy and the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of Kåñëa. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.

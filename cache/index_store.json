Within  the Bhagavad-gîtå are the answers to the mysteries of existence – our real pur- pose in this world, how we should act and why we suffer, or are oftentimes helpless in our struggle for survival. To  understand  the Bhagavad-gîtå  one  must  enter  into the  spirit  of  the Gîtå  by  accepting  the  path  of  devotion (bhakti). Accordingly, the Gîtå’s message cannot be prop- erly  understood  by  mental  speculation. To  this  end,  the sublime   process   illuminated   within   the Gîtå   must   be accepted as given by the speaker Himself, Çrî K®ß√a. The  active  principle  of  understanding  the  message  of the Gîtå  is  to  hear  directly  from  the  Master  of yoga,  Çrî K®ß√a, who is glorified throughout the Vedic literature as the Supreme Person, the Absolute Truth. Çrî K®ß√a speaks to  Arjuna  in Bhagavad-gîtå  and  thus  one  who  studies  the Gîtå hears from K®ß√a directly.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"f4c019b4-7374-442c-9aac-f7eb64d502dc":{"id_":"f4c019b4-7374-442c-9aac-f7eb64d502dc","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"becb429c-eeb0-4cc0-942f-35e483504738","metadata":{},"hash":"nRtX1fWVhUayJwPzI1I69tBSK6/YvwFcvuCAwTbHeMM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c2d2aa64-454e-43bb-a3bf-7e3a5c5d310c","metadata":{},"hash":"xQtrd3mVcv+ISvIJk7jOD0FdpzDzRjO2F3hnjVtHIdo="}},"hash":"KjUJXVT/KQIlrbjKwdgO6qeuA1D5TG8QZ2vGliypwYM=","text":"Gîtå hears from K®ß√a directly. The philosophy of Bhagavad-gîtå is clear for the sincere reader, yet for some, approaching the Gîtå may seem daunt- ing  –  its  language  too  ancient. However,  this  obstacle  is easily overcome by a straightforward translation and com- mentary (Anuv®tti). The requirement for a translation and commentary  on  the Gîtå  is  as  necessary  today  as  anytime in  the  past. With  the  passing  of  time,  our  values  and  our world  view  are  constantly  changing,  and  this  demands  a fresh approach to the understanding of the Gîtå. This translation and commentary on the Bhagavad-gîtå provides simple, yet profound knowledge to elevate us to a higher state of consciousness whereby we can realise our Preface x true self and progress towards attaining a life of spiritual fulfilment. Self-realisation  means  to  realise  our  actual purpose  in  life  and  act  towards  it,  gradually  freeing  us from the yoke of material bondage. Where there is light, darkness cannot stand — where there is proper knowledge, ignorance   cannot   remain. The Bhagavad-gîtå   unravels the  mysteries  of  life,  providing  not  only  knowledgeable answers, but also a progressive process to uplift us to pure consciousness. One  of  the  more  remarkable  features  of  the Gîtå  is that  its  readers  can  easily  observe  and  feel  its  philosophy working, like poetry in motion, in their everyday lives. The knowledge of Bhagavad-gîtå is a true science – its formu- las for success clear and observable in action. The Bhaga- vad-gîtå  thus  provides  a  complete  outline  for  self-realisa- tion in everyday life.

Also known as the Gîtopanißad,   the Bhagavad-gîtå   has   been   the   principle handbook of yoga for more than 5,000 years. In contrast to many mundane literatures of the present day, the Bhaga- vad-gîtå  is  free  from  mental  speculation  and  is  complete in  knowledge  of  the  eternal  self  (åtmå),  the  process  of bhakti-yoga  and  the  nature  and  identity  of  the  Absolute Truth, Çrî K®ß√a. As such, the Bhagavad-gîtå is the single most important book in the world, surpassing all others in wisdom and enlightenment. The first word of Bhagavad-gîtå is dharma. Sometimes dharma is mistaken to mean religion or a particular belief, but  it  is  not  so. Dharma  means  the  quintessential  duty or  knowledge  that  elevates  our  consciousness  to  a  direct connection  with  the  Absolute  Truth. This  is  also  known as sanåtana-dharma,  the  occupational  duty  of  all  living beings.

If one  is  seeking  answers  to  the  age-old  questions  of  ‘Who am  I?’ ‘Why  do  we  suffer?’ ‘Where  do  we  come  from?’ ‘What is the purpose of life?’ ‘What happens after death?’ – then one will find great satisfaction in the Bhagavad-gîtå because  the Gîtå  answers  these  questions  and  more  with the utmost clarity. Introduction xii As a young seeker of truth, I first came in contact with the Bhagavad-gîtå in 1968. In subsequent years I travelled to  India  and  studied Bhagavad-gîtå  under  the  foremost gurus of the late 20th Century, A.C. Bhaktivedånta Svåmî Prabhupåda  and  Svåmî  B.R. Çrîdhara  Deva  Gosvåmî. By the goodwill of these two great masters, the essential mes- sage of Bhagavad-gîtå entered my heart and I was soon to be situated on the path of self-realisation. As  with  any  path  in  life,  one  will  certainly  encounter crossroads. The first crossroad that I came to while study- ing the Bhagavad-gîtå was to decide on the path – personal or impersonal. Was I to follow the path of personalism – to perfect the individual self, to enter into the spiritual sky of Vaiku√†ha planets and live eternally with the Supreme Person, Çrî K®ß√a?

I chose the former, personalism (bhakti-yoga). Bhagavad-gîtå is specifically meant for those following the  path  of bhakti-yoga. Many  impersonal  philosophers have tried to lay claim to the Gîtå over the years, at times even claiming to be Çrî K®ß√a – a claim that is exposed by the simple fact that they do not understand the message of Çrî K®ß√a in Bhagavad-gîtå, despite its profound clarity. Çrî K®ß√a  is  the  original  speaker  of Bhagavad-gîtå,  therefore He must know the message of the Gîtå better than anyone, and K®ß√a says in the Eighteenth Chapter that the message of the Gîtå is exclusively meant for those who are aspiring to know the Absolute Truth on the path of bhakti-yoga. Bhagavad-gîtå  is  certainly  a  scholarly  work,  but  one need not be a scholar to understand the Gîtå’s straightfor- xiii ward and simple message. Indeed, Arjuna, the first student of Bhagavad-gîtå,  was  not  a  scholar,  but  a  warrior. In  the past  many  great  scholars,  gurus  and  self-realised  masters have written illuminating commentaries to accompany the Gîtå  –  its  ‘as  it  is’  meaning,  its  poetry,  philosophy  and its  hidden  treasure  –  so  that  the  people  of  their  time,  as well as the people of future generations, may have a better appreciation of the message of Çrî K®ß√a.

To  meet  the  changing  times and the present necessity, yet another commentary is being presented – a brief commentary, or Anuv®tti. According to Viçvanåtha Cakravartî, a renowned com- mentator on the Bhagavad-gîtå from antiquity, the first six chapters  of  the Gîtå mainly pertain to karma,  the  second six  chapters  to bhakti  and  the  final  six  chapters  to jñåna.

Due to their righteous behaviour, Çrî K®ß√a always favoured the På√∂avas. After  numerous  failed  murder  attempts,  Duryodhana finally  challenged  the  På√∂avas  to  a  rigged  game  of  dice. Duryodhana cheated and won the game, and the På√∂avas lost their kingdom. The result was that the På√∂avas were forced into exile for thirteen years. After  completing  their  thirteen  years  of  exile,  the På√∂avas  returned  to  the  capital  and  requested  Duryo- dhana to return their rightful kingdom. When the proud Duryodhana flatly refused, they requested him to at least give them five villages to rule over. At this Duryodhana curtly remarked that he would not even give them enough land in which to drive a pin. Although the På√∂avas sent Çrî K®ß√a as an ambassador to  sue  for  peace,  Duryodhana  blatantly  refused  to  listen. War was now inevitable. Rulers as far west as Syria and as far east as China came to  take  part  in  the  battle  –  some  supporting  the  Kaura- vas due to their political designs, and others favouring the På√∂avas  due  to  their  piety.

The   significance   of   Kurukßetra   is   related   in   the Våmana  Purå√a  that  narrates  how  the  virtuous  king Kuru, the ancestral patriarch of the På√∂ava and Kaurava xviii Dynasty,  performed  rigorous  austerities  at  Kurukßetra. Because of this act, Kuru was given two blessings – firstly that  Kurukßetra  would  be  named  after  Kuru  and  sec- ondly, that anyone who died at Kurukßetra would attain the celestial planets. The Bhagavad-gîtå is spoken on the first day of the war at Kurukßetra. As the two armies prepare to fight, the blind Dh®taråß†ra sits in his court with his faithful servant Sañjaya and inquires from him as to what the virtuous På√∂avas are doing. Sañjaya, a disciple of the great sage Vyåsa, had been blessed  with  the  mystic  power  to  observe  the  conflict  far from the battlefield at the palace in Hastinåpura. Sañjaya then  narrates  to  the  old  emperor  the  sacred  conversation between Çrî K®ß√a and Arjuna. Thus the Bhagavad-gîtå was received  by  Sañjaya  and  repeated  to  Dh®taråß†ra  for  the spiritual benefit of all humanity. Svåmî B.V.

Anuv®tti War is nothing new to this world. Thousands of years ago wars were being fought, such as the one at Kurukßetra, to  resolve  the  differences  between  good  and  evil  and  for the  purpose  of  material  gain. From  ancient  times  to  our modern era, practically not a day on this Earth has passed when  someone,  somewhere,  was  not  fighting  over  some- thing. Throughout history men have gathered on the field of battle to fulfil their greed for wealth and glory, some- times nobly, but more often ignobly. The same is happen- ing  in  the  21st  Century. War  it  seems  is  an  unavoidable karmic destiny of human civilisation. Chapter 1 7 Peace,  on  the  other  hand,  is  rather  elusive. Peace  is talked about and even prayed for, but seldom makes more than a momentary appearance.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"56716a90-d834-43de-b051-3d625c1ce54f":{"id_":"56716a90-d834-43de-b051-3d625c1ce54f","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9a323f8e-e57b-4ca4-9d68-4bc9565c031e","metadata":{},"hash":"14slgaUDghNrDmF+suppBoMFZJ8/9Msodf1JZKtVIp4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"713c6c6e-5af9-463b-8749-d3ea05d2defe","metadata":{},"hash":"w+GHIGhPgMAatyB54UFAC8NMMc1nDLP3ywVR2oZbAgM="}},"hash":"U6+uoDu7Tv2jX0Qa6FGmHRk+QoVTNJndKgGcYfT3Snw=","text":"talked about and even prayed for, but seldom makes more than a momentary appearance. Most of our lives, even for the  humblest  of  souls,  are  spent  struggling  for  existence either  socially,  politically,  financially,  mentally  or  physi- cally. For most of us the temporary absence of any major crisis is what we would call peace. However, peace (or çånti as  it  is  known  amongst  yogîs)  is  a  state  of  consciousness and not a condition relative to the external affairs of the material world. Peace is an internal experience. The wisdom of the Vedic literature, Çrîmad Bhågavatam says, jîvo-jîvasya-jîvanaμ  –  one  living  being  is  food  for another  living  being. From  the  minutest  forms  of  life to  the  most  complex,  one  life  is  sustained  by  the  loss  of another. Thus, the basic principle for material existence is fundamentally flawed with violence. Peace then, for most of  us,  comes  in  doing  what  we  have  to  do  and  believing that we have done the right thing. Therein lies the fine line between  war  and  peace. Is  what  we  think  to  be  good,  or what we are conditioned to believe, actually right? The ability to discriminate between right and wrong, or in some cases good and evil, largely depends on the extent of knowledge from which we draw our conclusions. A poor fund of knowledge naturally results in faulty conclusions. Therefore, it is in our best interest to seek out the greatest source of knowledge – knowledge of the Absolute Truth, and familiarise ourselves with that. Bhagavad-gîtå  is  perhaps  the  most  widely  read  book of theistic knowledge in the world. Whatever knowledge one finds in similar books such as the Dhammapada, the Bible, the Torah, the Koran etc. is also found in the Bhaga- Bhagavad-gita 8 vad-gîtå.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"713c6c6e-5af9-463b-8749-d3ea05d2defe":{"id_":"713c6c6e-5af9-463b-8749-d3ea05d2defe","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"56716a90-d834-43de-b051-3d625c1ce54f","metadata":{},"hash":"U6+uoDu7Tv2jX0Qa6FGmHRk+QoVTNJndKgGcYfT3Snw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"261821b2-70d0-4dbe-b470-a3bd5ad824b5","metadata":{},"hash":"799yMjrvfgVNnPpRuityohfwSiyL12wQ3XAlXJAkFSQ="}},"hash":"w+GHIGhPgMAatyB54UFAC8NMMc1nDLP3ywVR2oZbAgM=","text":"Bhagavad-gita 8 vad-gîtå.

The  classic  commentators  on  Bhagavad-gîtå  have  all pointed  out  the  blunder  of  Duryodhana  at  Kurukßetra.  Particularly it has been mentioned that Duryodhana failed to  recognise  that  when  Çrî  K®ß√a,  the  Supreme  Person, was there to advise Arjuna, that Arjuna would be a most formidable opponent. History has shown us that wars are fought out of greed, hatred or religious prejudice. It is simply a convenience to think that, ‘God is on our side.’ The idea that ‘God is on our side’ is certainly a comforting thought and has accom- panied  men  into  almost  every  war  that  we  know  of  since the rise of Abrahamic religions. However, the problem has always been that in all these conflicts both sides assumed the banner of righteousness, declaring, ‘God wills it!’ This is sometimes called the ‘theology of convenience’. Even today it makes good to stir up the troops or rally the  suicide  bombers  to  their  deaths  by  declaring  that, “God  favours  our  cause.” It  is  a  fact  that  during  these dark periods of history, more people have died, and more innocent people put to death in the name of God, than by  any  other  single  unnatural  cause. Many  people  con- sider  despotic  political  regimes  as  the  ultimate  empires of  cruelty,  but  the  truth  is  that  religious  fanaticism  has brought far more unnecessary death to the world than any political system of government.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"1f037019-04be-4e3e-8af2-46c34b666d3a":{"id_":"1f037019-04be-4e3e-8af2-46c34b666d3a","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"772c0173-a68f-4797-a641-c9430581660b","metadata":{},"hash":"/aV5RUfjuUPC4wu+yLuL3dMaGPtJ9st/dRUWOibs7bM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c12c80b6-1bea-4216-9d02-8bda9805dce6","metadata":{},"hash":"t1tv0gWPuAo+8OLF1ozZk0iOwDSH8ATlQqjpHUnGqY8="}},"hash":"ZE3T5IRgqWpqel04AuBnYRM8nvq4IhB5n2WJ/CDqTTk=","text":"brought far more unnecessary death to the world than any political system of government. So  what  makes  the  war  at  Kurukßetra  any  different than modern wars fought for greed or between religious fanatics? Is it not simply jingoism to say that because Çrî K®ß√a, the Supreme Person, was on the side of the På√∂a- Bhagavad-gita 12 vas  that  they  were  correct  in  destroying  their  enemies?  The difference is that Kurukßetra was not fought because one side had a different religious ideology than the other. Kurukßetra was a fratricidal war – a family feud brought on by human faults: greed for sovereignty, failure in duty, envy, family attachment and falsely identifying the body as the self. But unlike any other war in history, Kurukßetra would record a profound lesson for the benefit of all future gen- erations. The  lesson  was  taught  by  Çrî  K®ß√a  in  the  form of Bhagavad-gîtå – a lesson that would enable humanity to overcome  its  mundane  shortcomings,  become  established in transcendence and attain self-realisation.

As a warrior Arjuna was duty-bound to fight, but seeing the ordeal that lay ahead he could not proceed. The world is certainly full of faults, dangers, unfortu- nate events, cruel and hateful designs to exploit others and a host of other qualities that one would certainly describe as evil. To quote Edmund Burke, the Irish statesman and Bhagavad-gita 16 philosopher, “The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to stand by and do nothing.” Arjuna had resolved in his mind not to fight, knowing that the destruction of the dynasty meant the loss of tradi- tion, the onslaught of degradation, the birth of unwanted children  etc. and  thus  evil  would  be  the  only  outcome.  Arjuna  also  understood  deep  within  himself  that  to  do nothing also assured grim repercussions.

In  contemporary  society  there  is  much  debate  as  to whether  God  exists  or  not. First  it  is  necessary  to  define what we mean by ‘God’ before His existence can be deter- mined  or  dismissed. Accordingly,  seers  of  the  truth  in ancient  India  have  concluded  that  if  there  is  a  God,  then God  must  necessarily  be  the  owner  and  proprietor  of everything; He must be all-powerful, the most famous, the most  beautiful,  the  possessor  of  all  knowledge  and  at  the same  time,  detached  or  renounced. After  careful  analysis, those  seers  of  truth  concluded  that  only  Çrî  K®ß√a  could be and is the ultimate fountainhead of Reality, the Abso- Chapter 2 31 lute Truth. These findings have been corroborated by many sages throughout the ages (from before 10,000 BCE) and are  dealt  with  extensively  in  the  Vedic  literatures  such  as the Vedas, Upanißads, Purå√as, Råmåya√a, Mahåbhårata, Vedånta-sütra, Çrîmad Bhågavatam and Brahma-saμhitå etc. îçvara ̇ parama ̇ k®ß√a ̇ sac-cid-ånanda vigraha ̇ anådir ådir govinda ̇ sarva-kåra√a-kåra√aμ K®ß√a is the Supreme Controller.

(Mahåbhårata, Udyoga-parva 71.4) Arjuna has become overwhelmed with compassion for those who are about to die on the battlefield. In fact, such is  his  grief  that  he  himself  is  prepared  to  die  rather  than kill his enemies. But Arjuna is a warrior and from a noble family, therefore K®ß√a advises Arjuna against his weakness of heart. If one is a warrior it is one’s duty to face the enemy and  not  cower  away. Fighting  is  indeed  a  nasty  business, but when duty calls, such fighting may be unavoidable. In ancient times, acts of aggression were abhorred and strictly Chapter 2 33 forbidden  in  society  and  between  nations. When  such aggression did occur, retaliation and war were acceptable. According to the great sage Vasiß†ha, there are six types of aggressors and according to Manu-saμhitå these aggressors are to be met with lethal response. agnido garadaç caiva çastra-på√ir dhanåpaha ̇ kßetra-dåråpahårî ca ßa∂ ete hyåtatåyina ̇ The arsonist who sets fire to one’s house, one who administers  poison,  one  who  attacks  with  deadly weapons,  one  who  usurps  a  nations  resources,  one","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"3912709b-fa65-404a-8d4c-8106eecf90df":{"id_":"3912709b-fa65-404a-8d4c-8106eecf90df","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b4b4407c-fdaf-4b6b-b919-5233133062a5","metadata":{},"hash":"uftd2BJ2L0/LqwlG9MwWTsGNXd+Zm8xQqjZRMttAMhc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"929cda8c-84ce-4f45-aae2-2683ba2c7960","metadata":{},"hash":"6CwEjFWy+I7L9yLNOOwiMrK1xqc5ITUwlPly4rMqWeU="}},"hash":"UT/xAWn80j7CCUpoGCCwPcXGRUGO+LdpkQNXN5kwlBA=","text":"weapons,  one  who  usurps  a  nations  resources,  one who  invades  and  occupies  a  sovereign  country  and one who kidnaps one’s family members - all should be considered as aggressors.

(Manu-saμhitå 8.350) These verses are according to the rules given in the laws of  society (artha-çåstra). Yet  the  laws  of  dharma  (dhar- ma-çåstra),  which  are  superior  to  the  artha-çåstra,  state that one should never inflict harm on any living being (må hiμsyåt sarva-bhütåni) – what to say of one’s family mem- bers and superiors? This was Arjuna’s dilemma. Being a softhearted devo- tee  of  Çrî  K®ß√a,  Arjuna  was  disinclined  to  take  up  arms against  his  family  members,  but  being  a  warrior  he  had to  face  his  destiny. In  this  state  of  bewilderment,  Arjuna 34 Bhagavad-gita decided to put aside his casual relationship with K®ß√a as a friend and accept Çrî K®ß√a as his guru (spiritual master). Thus K®ß√a accepted Arjuna as a disciple. According  to  Vedic  knowledge  there  are  numerous planets  and  parallel  universes  wherein  life  can  be  found.

If  one  performs  one’s  prescribed  duties  in  this  life  then accordingly, one is elevated to higher planets. However, if one neglects his duty then only infamy and descending to lower planets awaits one in the next life. K®ß√a  has  used  the  word anårya  meaning  ‘non-åryan’ to describe Arjuna’s disinclination to follow his prescribed Vedic  duties. For  centuries  there  has  been  much  contro- versy  about  who  is  an  åryan  and  where  the  åryans  came from. For the most part, all such considerations have been based  upon  bodily  designations  in  order  to  establish  one race of people as superior to another. But in Bhagavad-gîtå, according to the words of Çrî K®ß√a, the åryans are those who  carry  out  their  duties  in  accordance  with  the  Vedic injunctions. Thus  it  is  understood  that  the  word  åryan does  not  pertain  to  a  particular  race  of  people,  but  to  a conception of life and a way of living. Knowledge of the eternal existence of the infinite con- sciousness  (K®ß√a)  and  the  finite  individual  unit  of  con- sciousness (åtmå or the self) is the key to all Vedic wisdom. This  will  be  the  central  theme  of  K®ß√a’s  instruction  to Arjuna in this chapter.

Heat and cold, happiness and distress, pleasure and pain, birth and death – these are the perceptions of life experienced by those with no knowledge of consciousness. But those who are liberated from the bodily concept of life are awake in the conscious world and are always in balance, even in the face of opposing and contradictory situations in the material world. They are undisturbed.

However, the problem with such thinking is that there  is  no  concrete  evidence  whatsoever  to  explain  or demonstrate how lifeless matter ever developed the symp- toms of life. The Theory of Evolution, as the Darwinians understand it, is substantially defeated in the fossil record, since no ‘transitional species,’ that are supposed to reveal the  gradual  evolution  of  living  organisms  from  primitive species to advanced life forms, have ever been discovered. Furthermore, there is no suitable model to explain where matter originated. The numerous theories, new and ancient, that expound that  life  arose  from  matter  are  fundamentally  flawed  in many  ways. On  the  other  hand,  from  observing  micro- scopic living creatures to giant creatures like the elephant and whale, it is self-evident that life comes from life. Thus, the Vedic perspective on life is that all life comes from an intelligent life source, Çrî K®ß√a. Scientific interest in finding the cause of the universe, and  indeed  to  all  life,  is  certainly  laudable. Yet  when  all reasonable and honest research leads us to the conclusion that  life/consciousness  is  not  a  byproduct  of  matter  and the blueprint of intelligent design can be observed every- where and in all things, then it should also be intelligently concluded that Super Consciousness is the cause of matter, the universe and all living things.

It exists eter- nally as part and parcel of K®ß√a, as part and parcel of  the Super  Consciousness. In  the  Vedic  concept  of  the  Abso- lute Truth, K®ß√a exists eternally along with His energies. Consciousness by that measure is never created; it simply exists eternally as part and parcel of the Absolute Truth. The  characteristics  of  consciousness  are  described  as unborn, eternal, indestructible and timeless – that which is not destroyed when the body is destroyed. The effects of time on the material body are perceived as growth, main- tenance,  by-products,  old  age,  dwindling  and  death. But consciousness,  being  transcendental  to  matter,  transcends time and therefore never grows old, dwindles or dies. In certain religious traditions the Creator is sometimes visualised as being an old man in the sky. He is naturally thought  of  as  old  because  He  has  fathered  the  universe  a long  time  ago  and  He  is  the  oldest  of  all. But  here  again the conception of Bhagavad-gîtå differs dramatically. Con- sciousness is ever fresh and the source of consciousness, the Super Conscious Being, is always youthful and never old. Those  who  are  engrossed  in  material  affairs  and  who ignore the wisdom of Bhagavad-gîtå will find it very diffi- cult to overcome the bodily concept of life and understand the difference between matter and consciousness.

(Mu√∂aka Upanißad 3.1.9) The cycle of birth and death (saμsåra) is described as a natural phenomenon for one who is embodied. Although such  a  conception  may  be  considered  a  fatalistic  world view, both birth and death are an unwanted experience for the  embodied  consciousness. After  experiencing  life,  no sane person wants to die – everyone has the desire to live as long as possible. To that end, nowadays the producers of wonder drugs promise us eternal life, although no such life-giving cures exist  at  present  –  everyone  has  to  die  and  before  death comes, the wonder drugs and doctors fees are sure to bank- rupt  the  family  fortune. However,  death  is  an  unnatural experience. The  fact  that  everyone  seeks  everlasting  life should  be  indicative  that  such  a  pure  state  of  life  exists beyond birth and death.

Some  people  think  of the  consciousness  that  is  generally  called  åtmå  as  being human and other åtmås as being animal etc. But in reality no such distinction between a human åtmå and an animal åtmå exists. One transmigrates, according to one’s karma, through  many  lower  species  of  life  and  eventually  arrives at the human stage. Human  life  offers  one  the  opportunity  of  self-reali- sation or the chance to cultivate spiritual knowledge and awareness. One  who  attempts  to  become  self-realised  is not  always  successful  in  one  attempt  or  in  one  lifetime.  However,  Çrî  K®ß√a  gives  us  the  assurance  that  even  a little  endeavour  on  the  path  of  self-realisation  will  save us from the greatest fear, namely that of taking birth in a lower life form. The  perfection  of  self-realisation  in  the  yoga  system is called samådhi, or the complete absorption of our con- sciousness  in  the  Supreme. The  student  of  bhakti-yoga achieves such a state of self-realisation by following the 54 Bhagavad-gita instructions of Çrî K®ß√a with steady determination. This state  is  only  possible  due  to  the  great  boon  of  having attained a human form of life. However,  if  one  neglects  the  opportunity  of  self-real- isation  in  human  life  then  one  certainly  runs  the  risk  of sinking  down  into  animal  life  or  worse.

Yoga  is  the  practice  of  becoming  situ- ated beyond the modes of nature. Everyone in the material world is under the three modes of nature and only a true yogî can surpass these modes. Our activities are categorised in three ways – as action prescribed  by  the  Vedas  (karma),  unauthorised  action (vikarma)  and  transcendental  action  (akarma). Karma means those activities that derive a good result and some- 58 Bhagavad-gita times  promote  one  to  higher  planets  or  higher  standards of living. Vikarma are those activities that are against the Vedic  injunctions  and  cause  suffering  to  the  self  and  to other living creatures. Akarma means those activities that have neither good nor bad reactions. One  who  is  wise  and  who  knows  the  science  of  yoga always  strives  to  perform  the  activities  of  akarma.

These  perfections  are  –  becoming  very  small (a√imå-siddhi), becoming lighter than air (laghimå-siddhi), being  able  to  retrieve  anything  from  anywhere,  such  as extending  one’s  hand  while  in  New  York  and  picking  a mango  growing  in  India (pråpti-siddhi),  to  become  heav- ier than the heaviest (mahimå-siddhi), to create something wonderful or to destroy anything at will (îçitva-siddhi),  to control the material elements (vaçitva-siddhi), the ability to Chapter 2 59 fulfil all of one’s desires (pråkåmya-siddhi) and the ability to  assume  any  form  one  wishes  (kåmåvasåyitå-siddhi).

Simply suspending the senses without positive engage- ment for advancing in spiritual life is not very profitable. Many yogîs have tried giving up sense activities altogether, but  because  the  taste,  or  attachment,  for  sense-objects remains,  many  have  fallen  down  in  their  attempts. How- ever,  the  senses  of  the  bhakti-yogî  who  follows  K®ß√a’s direction  are  safeguarded  because  the  senses  are  engaged twenty-fours  hours  a  day  in  K®ß√a’s  service. As  such,  the taste for sensual satisfaction gradually dries up and disap- pears leaving the bhakti-yogî free to advance spiritually. One who cannot control the senses cannot concentrate the mind. Additionally, the senses are never actually satis- fied  by  material  engagement. The  senses  become  satiated for  sometime,  but  then  again  become  stimulated  with  an even greater avarice. Those who are servants of the bodily senses can never become masters of the self.

Arjuna  asks  K®ß√a  to  further  explain  wisdom  and  action Chapter 3 75 so that he may follow the proper path. This confusion is common amongst novices – should one be a philosopher who is indifferent to the affairs of the material world, or should one engage in one’s prescribed duties?

This  is,  in  short,  a  universal  law  of  taxation. In other words, we must give the demigods their dues. It is also intrinsic to the nature of the åtmå, to perform service and sacrifice.

Another danger is the tendency of neglecting one’s own duty and trying to perform the duty of another. In other words,  K®ß√a  tells  Arjuna  to  tend  to  his  own  business. Arjuna is a kßatriya and his duty, as already discussed, is to protect and defend the kingdom. Arjuna however, is show- ing  leanings  towards  renunciation  –  becoming  a  monk,  a sannyåsî. Arjuna  wants  to  abandon  his  duty  and  perform that  of  another,  but  K®ß√a  warns  him  that  this  is  not  a good idea. In fact, K®ß√a says it is even dangerous. K®ß√a explains that it is better to perform one’s own duty imper- fectly than perform another’s duty perfectly.

In  material  life  all  living  beings  are  in  a  per- petual state of transmigration from one birth to the next. Only  when  one  attains  pure  spiritual  consciousness  does saμsåra,  or  transmigration,  cease. K®ß√a  tells  Arjuna  that both of them have passed through many births that Arjuna has forgotten, but K®ß√a remembers them all. Because the living beings change bodies at the time of death,  they  also  forget  their  previous  lives. K®ß√a  is  the Absolute Truth and thus He does not change His body or transmigrate to another body at any time. Because He does not undergo a change of body He does not forget. K®ß√a is non-different from His body, whereas living beings in material  life  are  units  of  consciousness  that  are  embod- ied  by  material  elements. The  bodies  of  all  living  beings in  the  material  world  are  made  of  the  basic  elements  of earth,  water,  fire,  air,  space,  mind,  intelligence  and  false ego.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"8a2d45db-3a90-4f51-84c0-5033d85fe212":{"id_":"8a2d45db-3a90-4f51-84c0-5033d85fe212","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f86c6a57-6875-4f3e-a48e-8d2c406e3485","metadata":{},"hash":"6T9USX3ddusyyIu/aVDKVltLFokzAQHRUyYX99LfJn4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2519c0b5-7419-4f59-85a9-3154a95c5058","metadata":{},"hash":"srXY7mE4aOueqfDjavXL2U6hm2DFynR+XvhfSDiNKfU="}},"hash":"CJrzSkzGFHaff/7OAjrReUmSkE6MwlbTIqINfLRJVOY=","text":"ego.

Çrî K®ß√a not only remembers all His previous births, but  He  remembers  all  of  Arjuna’s  previous  births  also. This  is  the  characteristic  of  the  Absolute  Truth  who  is fully omniscient. 106 Bhagavad-gita The  knowledge  of yoga  being  lost  naturally  results  in a decline in dharma and a rise of adharma (false dharma). Malevolence  arises  out  of  adharma. When  this  occurs, K®ß√a  says  that  He  appears  in  the  world  to  re-establish the principles of dharma. Dharma is understood as duties, activities  and  practices  that  will  sustain  the  living  beings in  a  state  of  prosperity  and  enable  them  to  realise  their constitutional  position  as  conscious  parts  and  parcels  of the Absolute Truth, K®ß√a.

Now,  five  thousand  years  on,  we  are  in  the midst of the age known as Kali-yuga where the unheard of vices in Dvåpara-yuga are the norm of the day.

The acintya-bhedåbheda-tattva  philoso- phy is essentially the philosophy of simultaneous oneness and difference in the Absolute Truth, culminating in pre- ma-bhakti or divine love. As such, Çrî Caitanya Mahåprabhu has revealed the greatest philosophy of spiritual perfection in this world.

These  human tendencies  are  grouped  into  four  basic  classifications:  the intellectual,  martial,  mercantile  and  labourer  classes.

Indeed,  this  seems  quite  con- tradictory. In  contemporary  society,  especially  in  various yoga communities, karma is often spoken of without a clear understanding of what it actually is or how it is incurred. Chapter 4 119 The point Çrî K®ß√a wants to make clear is that actions performed  for  His  satisfaction  do  not  have  any  reaction in  the  sphere  of karma  or  vikarma. Actions  performed for  K®ß√a  are  in  the  category  of akarma,  producing  only spiritual  benefit  –  no  good  or  bad  material  effect. Good and  bad  karma  are  both  material  and  as  such  they  must be shaken off before one can become spiritually liberated. Generally we want good karma, but good karma means we will have to take birth again and enjoy its good effects. Bad karma,  of  course,  is  commonly  understood  as  some- thing undesirable or to be avoided because it causes suffer- ing, pain and distress. This is certainly true, but bad karma is simply the flip side of good karma and vice versa. This is called the karmic entanglement of material life – some- times enjoying and sometimes suffering. Akarma leads to liberation from all material entangle- ment  and  takes  one  to  the  plane  of  eternal  blissful  life  in full  knowledge  of  everything. While  engaging  in yoga,  a serious student should, as far as possible, lead a simple life beyond  duality  by  minimizing  material  hankerings,  con- trolling  the  mind  and  body  and  giving  up  possessiveness. Being  content  with  that  which  comes  of  its  own  accord, one should remain steadfast in the practice of yoga.

The very word ‘sacrifice’ conjures up images of bloodshed  –  and  rightfully  so. In  the  history  of  religions throughout  the  world,  from  antiquity  to  modernity,  the sacrifice of both animals and humans has been a common practice. Most  progressive  thinkers  however  now  view Chapter 4 123 human  and  animal  sacrifice  as  totally  repugnant  and  cer- tainly Çrî K®ß√a would be in complete agreement. The sacrifices mentioned here by K®ß√a mainly concern the performance of austerities, breath control, study of the Vedas,  purification  of  knowledge,  renunciation,  observing vows etc. The purpose of all such sacrifices is to advance in realisation of the Absolute Truth. It  is  often  said  that,  “God  is  one”  or  that,  “It  is  all one”. This is true, but there is a need to qualify such state- ments. God is the Absolute Truth, one without a second, but this does not mean that all living beings are God. The Bhagavad-gîtå is straightforward on the point that all living beings  are  eternally  individual  and  never  become  God  at any time. Similarly, God is always the Absolute Truth and nothing less. It  is  said  in  verse  24  that  the  utensils  of  sacrifice  are Absolute,  the  sacred  fire  is  Absolute,  the  priest  or  per- former  of  sacrifice  is  Absolute  and  one  who  is  always absorbed in thoughts of the Absolute attains the Absolute. This is not to say that the individuality of any of these is lost in the Absolute. Everything that comes in contact with the Absolute Truth acquires the qualities of the Absolute by association, but the individuality of each is maintained. The  point  is  also  made  that  practically  everything  in life depends on sacrifice, even worldly pleasures.

The  genuine  guru  is  a representative of K®ß√a (Paramåtmå) and is of two types – dîkßå and çikßå. The dîkßå-guru gives initiation and accepts the student or disciple as a member of the paramparå. Such initiations are not secret and are held in plain view of the public, but at the initiation ceremony the disciple receives the mahå-mantra and gåyatrî-mantras for meditation. The çikßå-guru is one who imparts practical instructions to the disciple for the progressive advancement in self-realisation. The function of dîkßå and çikßå may be performed by the same guru, or by different gurus, but in any case both the dîkßå  and  çikßå  gurus  must  be  representatives  of  K®ß√a. Thus, one should see the guru as non-different from K®ß√a and  should  offer  him  all  respect.

K®ß√a,  the  Absolute Truth, is infinite and the living beings are finite. 144 Bhagavad-gita It  is  sometimes  thought  that  God,  somehow  or  other, dies for the sins of the world. This is not a very intelligent idea, nor is it consistent with the spiritual science found in Bhagavad-gîtå. K®ß√a  says  that  He  does  not  cause  anyone to perform pious or impious activities nor does he accept the  reaction  of  anyone’s  actions. The  idea  that  God  dies for our sins is rejected. God is eternal; therefore He cannot and  does  not  die. The  living  beings  are  also  eternal,  but because  they  are  under  the  bodily  concept  of  life,  when the body dies they also experience death – although they actually do not die. Both the Absolute Truth and His parts and parcels are eternal, beyond death. In  verse  18  the  relative  vision  of  equality  is  expressed for one who is situated in transcendental knowledge.

This process is known as transmigration, or reincarnation. It is similar to the theory of evolution, but distinctly different at the same time. In the Vedic concept the species of life are not evolving one into the other (though change within species is accepted), rather it is the åtmå that is evolving in consciousness while transmigrating from one species to the next. In the human form of life, consciousness reaches its completeness through the process of yoga. Therefore,  a  wise  man  does  not  discriminate  between one person and another based on bodily differences. The wise see the åtmå present in all forms of life and not just in human life.

The famous compiler of the Yoga- sütras, Patañjali has explained the sequential order of the aß†å∫ga-yoga system as follows: First, one should practice yama that consists of obser- vances such as rising from bed before sunrise, taking bath, study of the Vedas and performing püjå (rituals). Niyama consists of controlling the senses by following regulative principles such as no intoxication, no illicit sex, no gambling and no eating of meat, fish or eggs. Next  one  begins  the  practice  of  åsana  by  physically conditioning the body through systematic bodily exercises and  postures  aimed  at  toning  and  bringing  into  balance one’s entire physical organism. 156 Bhagavad-gita Then one advances to the performance of prå√åyåma, controlling the inward and outward breath by systematic breathing  exercises  performed  in  conjunction  with  vari- ous åsanas. When  åsanas  and  prå√åyåma  are  performed or  taught  just  for  the  sake  of  health,  this  is  sometimes called ha†ha-yoga. After prå√åyåma  follows  pratyåhåra,  or  withdrawing the senses from the sense-objects and training the mind to become introspective and intuitively orientated. Then one is able to concentrate the mind on a single point without being  disturbed. This  is  known  as  dhåra√å,  or  attaining concentration. Once  having  acquired  the  ability  to  concentrate  the mind without distractions from external sources, one can begin actual meditation, or dhyåna.

The three prin- ciple objects of meditation in yoga are Brahman (transcen- dental light), Paramåtmå (localised Super Consciousness) and Bhagavån (Çrî K®ß√a). Samådhi  is  the  final  stage  of  aß†å∫ga-yoga  wherein  the yogî, at the time of quitting the material body, attains the object of his desired perfection. The yogîs who desire Brah- man or Paramåtmå realisation enter the brahma-jyoti after giving  up  their  body  and  the  yogî  who  desires  Bhagavån realisation enters into the Supreme Abode of K®ß√a known as Vaiku√†ha or Goloka V®ndåvana to associate with and participate in transcendental pastimes with K®ß√a. According to many masters of yoga, only Bhagavån real- isation  is  eternal. Even  after  attaining  Brahman  or  Para- måtmå realisations and merging into the Supreme Brahman, Chapter 6 157 a yogî  will  once  again  have  to  come  back  to  the  material world and begin again the cycle of birth and death. This is said to be due to the intrinsic nature of all living beings to  perform  activities. Although  in  the  brahma-jyoti  there is a sense of bliss that is many thousands of times greater than material happiness, still the desire to act remains. But because the Brahman realised yogî and the Paramåtmå real- ised yogî are not qualified to perform devotional activities in the association of K®ß√a, they cannot enter the spiritual planets and must therefore come down to take birth again in the material world.

Anuv®tti Çrî K®ß√a again informs Arjuna in verse 15 that the final goal of yoga  is  to  attain  His  Supreme  Abode  (Vaiku√†ha or Goloka V®ndåvana). This is indeed the ultimate goal of the yoga system. One  cannot  be  a  yogî  if  one  eats  too  much  or  not enough. Eating  too  much  also  means  eating  things  like non-vegetarian foodstuff to maintain the body. This is not actually required. Nor can one be a yogî if one does not eat enough. This also means that one should not abstain from eating  milk  products  by  considering  it  as  non-vegetarian.  Milk  is  the  most  complete  food  possible. Milk  products help  to  develop  a  strong  bodily  constitution  and  nourish our  brain  cells  and  thus  our  thinking  capacity. Yoga  is something that has been practiced in India for thousands of years and from then until now, yogîs have recommended taking milk and milk products like yogurt and cheese etc.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"bce44f14-986e-46a1-9021-531f2d337089":{"id_":"bce44f14-986e-46a1-9021-531f2d337089","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bc87adf8-2611-4233-99e7-5868f2ef53d1","metadata":{},"hash":"1UUN/Vn8Mw0xpmHqkJMdarXzfcgN1Nh7/sBzPJMbThg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"45ad65e8-cfe6-4070-8980-283c353de7cd","metadata":{},"hash":"qiaTu/btnlSVqB585DKofkbB56b12qJB6spUmhGLBTU="}},"hash":"EIiHxZWWkbtSIqT+iYXZ1Bmc85jmz1fuClKO0JqkQhg=","text":"taking milk and milk products like yogurt and cheese etc. Only in recent times have some people thought it bad to Chapter 6 161 take milk products, but the masters of yoga have never rec- ommended such abnegation. Proper sitting posture, control of the senses and observ- ing  celibacy  are  also  recommended  in  the  above  verses because  without  such  practices  no  one  can  actually  be  a yogî. Gazing  at  the  tip  of  the  nose  without  casting  one’s glance  in  other  directions  means  being  perfectly  concen- trated,  as  in  dhåra√å,  and  performing  dhyåna,  or  medita- tion on K®ß√a as the highest goal. As  far  as  possible,  a  yogî  should  try  to  live  in  a  holy place to practice yoga. In India yogîs are fond of residing on the  banks  of  the  Ganges  at  Haridvåra,  H®ßîkeça,  Benares, or Måyåpura, or on the banks of another sacred river like the  Yamunå,  Kåverî  or  Godåvarî. Some yogîs  prefer  the sanctuary of the Himålayas, others prefer residence in the cåra-dhåma  (Dvårakå,  Badarînåtha,  Jagannåtha  Purî  and Råmeçvaram). In any case, the yogî must choose the proper place to practice yoga. If one is unable to live in a holy place or on the banks of a sacred river, then one should try to live in an åçrama or yoga community. If one is unable to live in a yoga com- munity then one should sanctify one’s home by creating a place where K®ß√a can be worshipped and mantra medita- tion can be performed. The home should have an atmos- phere conducive for contemplation, study and controlling the senses.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"45ad65e8-cfe6-4070-8980-283c353de7cd":{"id_":"45ad65e8-cfe6-4070-8980-283c353de7cd","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bce44f14-986e-46a1-9021-531f2d337089","metadata":{},"hash":"EIiHxZWWkbtSIqT+iYXZ1Bmc85jmz1fuClKO0JqkQhg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"059b1ba2-33d6-4a35-ace9-928f613ad239","metadata":{},"hash":"Cp3rLLGiiuDU4M4PEF7vNqbSaG54BRWb/pwcPHBXJWQ="}},"hash":"qiaTu/btnlSVqB585DKofkbB56b12qJB6spUmhGLBTU=","text":"phere conducive for contemplation, study and controlling the senses.

Subsequently, it is very difficult to find the  appropriate  place  for  yoga  practice,  especially  for  the 162 Bhagavad-gita practice of aß†å∫ga-yoga, råja-yoga, ha†ha-yoga and so on.

The yogî must always strive for self-satisfaction, knowl- edge and realisation. Such a yogî will always see everything in  this  world  with  equal  vision  and  therefore  will  not become attached to anything of a temporary nature.

This is not to say that the yogî cannot distinguish the bril- liance  of  gold  from  that  of  ordinary  objects;  this  means that the yogî is not attracted to finding satisfaction in the accumulation of wealth.

Anuv®tti Control of the mind is quintessential for the practice of yoga. The problem arises due to the very nature of the mind itself. The nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady; it wants to wander here and there from one sense-object to the next. Even in sleep the wandering mind is active. But Çrî K®ß√a says that the yogî must always endeavour to bring the mind under control of his higher conscious self. This is indeed the foremost challenge that a yogî faces. In  some  western  philosophical  systems  the  mind  is conceived  of  as  the  self,  but  this  does  not  hold  true  in yoga. In  yoga,  the  mind  is  called  ‘the  sense  within’.

But in yoga the self is conceived of as a  transcendental  substance  that  exists  independent  of  the mind and body. Therefore, according to the knowledge of yoga, the self survives the death of the body and mind. It is something completely different. There are many external practices within the yoga system such as fasting and living in a secluded place that help to Chapter 6 167 control  the  mind. But  owing  to  the  nature  of  the  mind being like the wind, these external methods frequently fall short of the mark. However, in the bhakti-yoga system it is recommended  to  control  the  mind  by  mantra. The  word mantra  originates  from  two  Sanskrit  words  –  mana  (the mind)  and  tråyate  (to  control). By  engaging  the  mind  in the process of hearing and chanting mantras – and espe- cially the mahå-mantra, the great mantra for delivering the mind – the wandering mind becomes steady in the self. The mahå-mantra  is  a  direct  sound  representation  of the Absolute Truth, Çrî K®ß√a. As such, the mahå-mantra is  both  all-powerful  and  all-attractive. The  power  of  the mahå-mantra  removes  the  ignorance  that  covers  the  real identity  of  the  living  being  and  the  all-attractive  nature of  the  mahå-mantra  fills  the  heart  of  the  chanter  with inconceivable ånanda, supreme spiritual bliss. Chanting of the mahå-mantra to control and steady the mind has been highly recommended for these reasons.

Therein lies the open secret to Chapter 6 171 understanding Bhagavad-gîtå. K®ß√a  says  what  He  means and means what He says – therefore an abstract commen- tary on Bhagavad-gîtå is not necessary. That  Çrî  K®ß√a  is  everywhere,  in  all  things  and  within the  hearts  of  all  living  beings  is  confirmed  by  the  above verses.

Anuv®tti Arjuna’s questions in verses 37 and 38 are very critical for our  understanding. Arjuna  wants  to  know  what  happens  to one who practices yoga for sometime, but for some reason or another, does not become completely self-realised and gives up  the  body  at  death  without  having  attained  perfection.  What is the destination of such a person in the next life? The first thing to note here is that Arjuna is aware or completely convinced that this one life is not the all-in-all. As  Çrî  K®ß√a  has  said  previously,  we  have  had  many  lives in the past and we will have many in the future. Therefore Arjuna  wants  to  know  of  his  fate  or  that  of  anyone  who practices yoga but does not reach perfection. What will be the fate of such a person in the next life? K®ß√a’s  reply  is  that  of  the  all-knowing,  omniscient Supreme Being. K®ß√a says that for the yogî there is never any  loss. If  one  does  not  achieve  perfection  in  this  life then  in  the  next  life  one  will  be  born  in  favourable  cir- cumstances  and  begin  the  process  anew. In  the  next  life, one  will  again  become  attracted  to  the  practice  of  yoga and continue on the path. Even if it takes many lifetimes, 176 Bhagavad-gita the yogî, with perseverance and determination, attains the supreme destination. Therefore, K®ß√a tells Arjuna, in all circumstances, be a yogî. ॐ तिदित ीमहाभारते शतसाहां संिहतायां","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"df4b40fc-5992-4c14-a0f4-b6fa74b59db8":{"id_":"df4b40fc-5992-4c14-a0f4-b6fa74b59db8","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"13b99cb4-dcee-4531-96fd-cf50b10c0439","metadata":{},"hash":"noUXcboRQPgOyXHpF96KMmoF48c/O4b9QX+EfUVmJVA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"114f4a93-05f8-45c2-bebe-b3f3fedea737","metadata":{},"hash":"H5OtYcaS2eRaz7dSSBCtKEntr+7FV9U0qRgEhmFlKEQ="}},"hash":"NPB8EfM+DWj2H/8Rbykj7QZX4w46fifJF7Zni3OQzdA=","text":"वैयािसां भीपवािण ीमगवीतासूपिनष िवायां योगशाे ीकाजनसंवादे ानयोगो नाम षोऽायः॥ oμ tat saditi çrî-mahåbhårate-çata-såhasryåμ saμhitåyåμ vaiyåsikyåμ bhîßma-parvå√i çrîmad bhagavad-gîtåsüpanißatsu brahma-vidyåyåμ yoga-çåstre çrî k®ß√årjuna-saμvåde dhyåna-yogo nåma ßaß†ho’dhyåya ̇ OÂ TAT SAT – Thus ends Chapter Six entitled Dhyåna Yoga from the conversation between Çrî K®ß√a and Arjuna in   the Upanißad   known   as Çrîmad  Bhagavad-gîtå,   the yoga-çåstra  of  divine  knowledge,  from  the Bhîßma-parva of Mahåbhårata,  the  literature  revealed  by  Vyåsa  in  one hundred thousand verses.

Jñåna  means  knowledge  of  self  as  distinguished from non-self, or knowledge that the self is not the body. Vijñåna  means  realised  knowledge  or  realisation  of  one’s intrinsic relationship with K®ß√a. Çrîmad Bhågavatam also mentions jñåna and vijñåna as follows: jñånaμ parama guhyaμ me yad vijñåna-samanvitam sa-rahasyaμ tad a∫gaμ ca g®hå√a gaditaμ mayå Knowledge (jñåna) about K®ß√a as described in the Vedic  literatures  is  very  confidential,  and  it  has  to be realised (vijñåna) in conjunction with the secrets of devotion. (Çrîmad Bhågavatam 2.9.31) When we speak of knowledge, modern man immedi- ately  thinks  of  scientific  knowledge  which  he  deems  to be most perfect. However, jñåna in Bhagavad-gîtå refers to  that  knowledge  of  the  self  as  distinguished  from  the knowledge of matter or scientific knowledge. Knowledge of  matter  is  called  aparå-vidyå  and  it  is  quite  distinct from the knowledge of the self in that it never leads to self-realisation. Since the beginning of the Rationalist movement, some five centuries ago, science has completely rejected the idea of consciousness as independent of matter.

Many scientific theories  have  been  presented  to  explain  the  origin  of  the universe and the origin of life such as the ‘Big Bang’ and Darwinian Evolution, but these explanations remain mere theories, lacking conclusive evidence. Chapter 7 181 For centuries, scientific and theistic communities have been at odds with each other, but recently it appears that the two may finally be drawing closer. Leading persons in the  scientific  community  are  willing  to  accept  conscious- ness  as  a  scientific  fact. Indeed,  biologist  and  stem-cell therapist, Dr. Robert Lanza has of late rocked the scien- tific world with his book, Biocentrism – How Life Creates the Universe, in which he postulates that consciousness has evolved matter and not that matter has evolved conscious- ness. If  this  current  trend  continues  then  indeed  science may very well be on the path of jñåna. The  understanding  of  consciousness  being  the  origin  of matter has taken a long time to manifest. But as K®ß√a says in verse 3, those who endeavour for perfection are very rare, and rarer  still  are  those  who  actually  understand  K®ß√a. To  this end, all learned and educated people in the world should take lessons from Bhagavad-gîtå.

How- ever,  once  again  the  scientific  community  finds  itself facing  serious  problems  wherein  an  elusive  element  must be present in the universe in order for them to explain how the universe works. This element, physicists say, may com- prise up to 80% or more of the universe, but is unknown to them and is thus far undetectable. They have called this ‘Dark Matter’. Chapter 7 183 The  first  person  to  provide  evidence  and  infer  the existence  of  the  phenomenon  of  Dark  Matter  was  the Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky, of the California Insti- tute  of  Technology  in  1933. Zwicky  applied  the  viral theorem to the Coma cluster of galaxies and obtained evi- dence of unseen mass. Zwicky estimated the cluster’s total mass  based  on  the  motions  of  galaxies  near  its  edge  and compared  that  estimate  to  one  based  on  the  number  of galaxies and total brightness of the cluster. He found that there was about four-hundred times more estimated mass than  was  visually  observable. The  gravity  of  the  visible galaxies in the cluster would be far too small for such fast orbits, so something extra was required. This is known as the ‘Missing Mass Problem’. Based on these conclusions, Zwicky inferred that there must be some non-visible form of  matter  that  would  provide  enough  of  the  mass  and gravity to hold the cluster together. That was the begin- ning of the search for Dark Matter. Seventy-eight  years  later,  science  is  still  looking  for Dark Matter. They know it is literally everywhere, but it escapes  detection  and  thus  they  are  unable  to  observe  it.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"1765902a-b275-4b16-8012-3b8b225af251":{"id_":"1765902a-b275-4b16-8012-3b8b225af251","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a03b5a4b-7edf-4e85-a547-60afe36dbe51","metadata":{},"hash":"n54u+W9+6o32sbugu/ubdggXDr/bPK4FSaNZ5heNm0Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"004b22df-3788-466e-a91e-963c22d50ab1","metadata":{},"hash":"EdrEp15qhGRUqcT5bVqeVs8ZuQbmQ6mykT47EMpHz7c="}},"hash":"kfJNtS8FePutyfTMPXM6R0kYd9PZNMft2bSvFNmXz8A=","text":"Millions in taxpayers’ money is spent every year by western scientists in the search for Dark Matter. Nothing has yet been discovered. However,  the  Çrîmad Bhågavatam  identifies  a  material element that among its other qualities is, for the most part, elusive. It  is  all-pervading,  but  simultaneously  it  is  unde- tectable. That  element  according  to  Bhågavatam  is  called nabhas, or as mentioned here in Bhagavad-gîtå, khaμ. The activities, qualities and characteristics of the khaμ element  can  be  observed  as  accommodating  space/room 184 Bhagavad-gita for existence. Space itself, both internal and external, is the element khaμ. This then, if taken notice of by physicists, may very well fit nicely into the ‘Missing Mass Problem’. Khaμ,  being  a  material  element,  could  theoretically  be assigned  a  numerical  code  –  then  they  might  find  what they are looking for. In  the  Vedic  way  of  thinking,  a  physical  element  is secondary  to  its  qualities  –  when  the  qualities  of  a  par- ticular thing are understood, it is as good as or better than having  the  gross  object  at  hand.

(Çrîmad Bhågavatam 3.26.34) This  verse  is  the  potential  basis  for  great  scientific research work. It explains how subtle forms are generated from nabhas,  what  their  characteristics  and  actions  are, and how the tangible elements, namely air, fire, water and earth, are manifested from the subtle form. Bhågavatam does not simply list the basic material ele- ments, but explains quite scientifically how those elements evolve  from  the  most  subtle  plane  of  existence  up  to  the Chapter 7 185 divisions of the universe – this is quite elaborate and sci- entific indeed. Yet for science to take full advantage of this understanding of matter and to discover how the universe came into being, they will have to do more than just add khaμ to  their  table  of  elements  –  they  will  have  to  add aha∫kåra  (false  ego),  mana  (the  mind)  and  buddhi  (intel- ligence). For  indeed,  Bhagavad-gîtå  lists  these  as  material elements. Furthermore,  these  elements,  aha∫kåra,  mana and buddhi are categorised as even more subtle than khaμ, because they are closer in character to consciousness (åtmå). Beyond  the  gross  and  subtle  material  elements  being added  to  the  scientific  table,  Bhagavad-gîtå  says  that  a complete  understanding  of  existence  and  reality  is  not possible without adding two transcendental, anti-material concepts  –  namely  åtmå  and  Paramåtmå  (consciousness and  Super  Consciousness). This,  it  seems,  science  strug- gles with even more than Dark Matter. We have dubbed these ‘Light Matter’. Mind and intelligence should not be confused with the self or åtmå.

K®ß√a  further  explains  that  pious  persons  (the  dis- tressed,  the  inquisitive,  those  seeking  wealth  and  those desiring self-realisation) take shelter of Him, but of these K®ß√a says that those in search of knowledge and self-real- isation are superior. After taking shelter of Çrî K®ß√a for wealth, out of curi- osity or out of distress, it is often seen that such persons again  resume  their  normal  course  of  material  activities.  Those who come to K®ß√a for knowledge and self-realisa- tion truly become liberated from material desires and enter into a plane of eternal bliss. Ultimately they attain K®ß√a’s Supreme Abode, never to return to the world of birth and death  as  will  be  explained  in  Chapter  15. Therefore,  the seekers  of  self-realisation  who  take  shelter  of  K®ß√a  and absorb all their thoughts and deeds in K®ß√a are considered the best among virtuous persons.

Everyone  is  dying,  and  for  the  most  part  dying  without answers to life’s most basic questions.

However, in this material world death of the body comes to everyone. There  are  no  exceptions. But  for  those  whose  mind  and intelligence  are  fixed  on  K®ß√a,  they  do  not  take  birth again in the material world, but attain K®ß√a’s own divine nature.

As K®ß√a will explain in Chapter 15, one who attains His Supreme Abode does not return to this material world. When we speak of saμsåra, we are indeed talking about reincarnation.

To many, reincarnation means being born Chapter 8 207 as a human being life after life, but this is not a fact. The human form of life is only rarely achieved. It is not some- thing that comes in rapid succession. Above and below the human species there are hundreds and thousands of other life forms. According to one’s activities performed in this life and one’s final consciousness and state of mind at the time of death, one‘s next birth is determined. In  the  species  below  the  human  being,  namely  animal, aquatic, insect and plant life, there is great ignorance and suffering. Above the human plane there are higher planets full of celestial beings and celestial pleasures. Yet higher or lower, all stations of life in the material world are tempo- rary. There is no place of eternal damnation and no place of  eternal  happiness  in  the  material  universe. Nothing in  this  world  is  everlasting. Only  the  abode  of  K®ß√a  is beyond the dualities of pleasure and suffering. K®ß√a  says  above  in  verse  5, anta-kåle  ca  måm  eva smaran muktvå kalevaram  – one  who  remembers  Him  at the  time  of  death  attains  His  transcendental  nature.

Consciousness  pervades  the  entire  body,  but  is  said  to be  centred  in  one  of  the  seven cakras  –  mülådhåra-cakra (located  at  the  base  of  the  genital), svådhiß†håna-cakra (located  at  the  base  of  the  spinal  cord), ma√ipüra-cakra (located  in  the  navel  area), anåhata-cakra  (located  in  the heart), viçuddha-cakra  (located  in  the  throat), åjñå-cakra (located in between the eyebrows) and the sahasråra-cakra (located at the top of the head). Chapter 8 211 When consciousness is situated in the lower three cakras one is found to be preoccupied with the animal tendencies of  eating,  sleeping,  mating  and  defending. When  con- sciousness is situated in the upper cakras there is progress in the finer sentiments of spiritual culture and ultimately liberation. Consciousness is raised in meditation from one cakra  to  another  through  the  subtle  passage  in  the  body known as the sußum√å-nå∂î. K®ß√a says that the yogî should bring his consciousness to  be  seated  in  the  åjñå-cakra,  sometimes  known  as  the ‘third eye’.

However, if the said yogî does not make Çrî K®ß√a the object of his medita- tion, then he may enter the brahma-jyoti for sometime, but eventually he returns to this material world.

Çrîdhara Mahåråja, a great åcårya of bhakti-yoga, when K®ß√a speaks in the third person, He is referring to the  object  of  meditation  as  His  expansion  as  Paramåtmå (Super Consciousness). As already explained in the Second Chapter,  Çrî  K®ß√a  manifests  Himself  as  the  Paramåtmå, present in the hearts of all living beings. Therefore, medi- tation on the Paramåtmå means meditation on K®ß√a. Those  who  cannot  comprehend  the  Absolute  Truth as personal, due to anarthas (misgivings of the heart), can meditate  on  K®ß√a’s  impersonal  aspect  as  Brahman. But this process is tedious and the results are limited since even the  Brahman-realised yogî  must  once  again  return  to  the world of birth and death.

However, it should be noted here that the divisions of yoga, such as sense-control  and  celibacy,  must  also  be  in  place  before the chanting of mantras  can  be  effective.

One who has performed these activities is reborn on a higher planet and lives a long life, enjoying great luxury for tens of thousands of years. However,  the bhakti-yogî  has  no  desire  to  enjoy  in higher planets. He easily achieves all the benefits of sacri- fice, penance etc. simply by surrendering to Çrî K®ß√a. The bhakti-yogî does not have to choose an auspicious moment to leave the material body because he is under the shelter of K®ß√a. Everything  is  auspiciously  ordained  for  those  who have surrendered to K®ß√a, enabling them to reach K®ß√a’s eternal abode.

In  verse  3  K®ß√a  uses  the  word açraddadhånå ̇. Çrad- dhå means ‘faith’ and açraddhå means ‘without faith’. This describes  those  who  do  not  have  the  resolute  determina- tion  to  perform bhakti-yoga. Of  such  persons  K®ß√a  says that  they  will  continue  in  the  cycle  of saμsåra. That  is not to say that they are damned to some eternal hell, but simply put, they cannot attain the platform of liberation. First  it  is  important  to  understand  that çraddhå  is  not to  be  confused  with  the  belief  or  mundane  faith  that  is usually associated with a particular religion such as Juda- ism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism. Christian faith,  Muslim  faith,  Hindu  faith  etc. implies  a  belief  in a  particular  set  of  moral  ideals,  myths,  superstitions  and dogmas, but çraddhå is something entirely different. Chapter 9 227 Çrat dadhåti iti çraddhå ̇  –  ‘That  which  leads  to  truth and self-realisation is known as çraddhå.’ Çraddhå is devel- oped by association with saintly persons who are self-real- ised and free from the contamination of material nature. In such association the conviction develops that by surrender and taking shelter of K®ß√a all other purposes are served. Without such çraddhå and fixed determination, one cannot follow the path of bhakti-yoga.

When presented with an intel- ligent  proposal,  a  rationalist  should  be  willing  to  accept it, regardless of where that proposal leads, even if it leads to undermine his atheistic world view. Such would be the mentality of a real seeker of truth or science.

We say ‘false renunciation’ because  real  renunciation  means  to  renounce  the  idea  of oneself being the proprietor and enjoyer and to recognise K®ß√a as the proprietor and the enjoyer of everything. In the stage of real renunciation, one offers everything first to K®ß√a and accepts only the remnants of such offer- ings for his maintenance.

The process of offering food to K®ß√a  by  chanting  appropriate mantras  is  to  be  learned from the guru. When food is offered to K®ß√a by mantra the food becomes ‘K®ß√anised’. This is called prasådam, or K®ß√a’s mercy. Çrî  K®ß√a  says  that  if  one  offers  Him  with  devotion a  leaf,  flowers,  fruits  or  some  water  He  will  accept  that. Chapter 9 239 This  means  that  non-vegetarian  foodstuff  such  as  meat, fish  and  eggs,  as  well  as  preparations  containing  such things are not offerable to K®ß√a. Food offerable to K®ß√a includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, grains and milk products. It should be noted that being Gopåla, the protector of the cows, K®ß√a is very fond of milk products such as yogurt, butter etc. A diet of such food offered to K®ß√a will make one healthy and fit for the practice of yoga as well as free from karmic reactions.

Anuv®tti It is important to note here that Çrî K®ß√a says that He is equal to all living beings. That is to say that K®ß√a has no  ‘chosen  people’. Everyone  is  equal  in  His  eyes  as  His eternal parts and parcels. K®ß√a does not arbitrarily cause one person to enjoy life and another to suffer. Enjoyment and suffering are the results of one’s own pious or impious activities in this life and in past lives. When  one  approaches  K®ß√a,  He  reciprocates  directly with that person. One does not have to be born in a par- ticular  country,  family,  religion,  caste,  gender  or  race  to approach  K®ß√a. Nor  is  one  first  required  to  perform certain pious activities such as penances or charity before one can approach Him. The door is open to everyone and K®ß√a reciprocates with each individual accordingly. But  there  is  also  no  doubt  that  those  who  are  deeply devoted  to  K®ß√a  and  have  taken  shelter  of  Him  com- pletely,  are  very  dear  to  Him  and  at  the  end  of  life  they will surely come to K®ß√a in His Supreme Abode. 242 Bhagavad-gita ॐ तिदित ीमहाभारते शतसाहां संिहतायां","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"4c42462f-b408-4b60-9f6f-08e789b58468":{"id_":"4c42462f-b408-4b60-9f6f-08e789b58468","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ea6959e9-80af-444f-a6d8-3b5d37a9c966","metadata":{},"hash":"EsHbvJsQ7tlzeBTmfff2BGGIFF8sBFCpt9vgH54vm90="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2b4d381e-2afb-49eb-82cb-5e4816d14e06","metadata":{},"hash":"JK14j17t5E57G3X4UwWRIQpqRqnnnkW5bEIcMe6Ohwk="}},"hash":"HDUDvrAXouRlz7UUrztEtPvlHoEn/5LIdGsYkNbLmHU=","text":"वैयािसां भीपवािण ीमगवीतासूपिनष िवायां योगशाे ीकाजनसंवादे राजगयोगो नाम नवमोऽायः॥ oμ tat saditi çrî-mahåbhårate-çata-såhasryåμ saμhitåyåμ vaiyåsikyåμ bhîßma-parvå√i çrîmad bhagavad-gîtåsüpanißatsu brahma-vidyåyåμ yoga-çåstre çrî k®ß√årjuna-saμvåde råja-guhya-yogo nåma navamo’dhyåya ̇ OÂ TAT SAT – Thus ends Chapter Nine entitled Råja- Guhya Yoga from the conversation between Çrî K®ß√a and Arjuna  in  the Upanißad  known  as Çrîmad  Bhagavad-gîtå, the yoga-çåstra  of  divine  knowledge,  from  the Bhîßma- parva  of Mahåbhårata,  the  literature  revealed  by  Vyåsa  in one hundred thousand verses.

Though K®ß√a is their origin, not even the demigods and the great sages such as Brahmå, Indra, Sanaka, Durvåså, Marîci and others  know  K®ß√a  as  He  is. But  one  who  is  K®ß√a’s  dev- otee,  the bhakti-yogî,  knows  K®ß√a  as  the  Supreme  Person situated in the core of his heart. sa vai puμsåμ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokßaje ahaituky-apratihatå yayåtmå suprasîdati The topmost dharma for mankind is that by which they can attain devotion unto the Supreme Person, who is adhokßaja and who cannot be known by the material  senses.

Anuv®tti By  the  end  of  Chapter  Ten,  Arjuna  is  completely convinced  that  Çrî  K®ß√a  is  the  Supreme  Person  and  that all creation manifests from Him and remains in Him after annihilation. But in order that future generations may not mistake  K®ß√a  for  an  ordinary  man  or  simply  a  philoso- pher,  Arjuna  requests  K®ß√a  to  reveal  His  universal  form (viçvarüpa) – the form of K®ß√a wherein everything in the universe  is  contained. This  form  cannot  be  seen  by  any independent  endeavour,  but  completely  depends  on  the mercy of K®ß√a for Arjuna to behold. Arjuna also knows that in the future unscrupulous men will claim to be God and mislead ignorant people. There- fore, Arjuna wants K®ß√a to show His universal form as the benchmark  so  that  anyone  claiming  to  be  God  should  be able to show the universal form to confirm their position. Indeed, Arjuna’s foresight was accurate. Since the time of  K®ß√a,  and  especially  in  modern  times,  many  so-called ‘godmen’  have  stepped  forward  in  society  and  claimed  to be  K®ß√a  or  God  incarnate. Unfortunately,  the  masses  of people  are  so  ignorant  that  they  accept  such  impostors.

The universal form Chapter 11 273 is  not  possible  to  perceive  with  the  eyes  of  this  material body. For such a vision as Arjuna was to receive, one needs divine eyes. In other words, Arjuna’s vision of the universal form was subjective and could only be revealed by K®ß√a. Within that vision Arjuna was able to see in one place all  that  is,  all  that  was,  all  that  will  ever  be,  everything moving  and  non-moving  in  an  instant. As  we  will  see  in this chapter, after seeing the universal form of K®ß√a which Arjuna  describes  as  wonderful,  astonishing,  fiery,  terrible and devastating, he becomes fearful and asks K®ß√a to once again  show  him  His  charming  and  beautiful  form  as  the Supreme Person.

Awe and reverence borders on fear and as  we  shall  see,  Arjuna  does  indeed  become  fearful  as  he continues to behold K®ß√a’s universal form. Fear does not encourage a loving relationship with the Supreme. There- fore, the universal form of K®ß√a is not very important for students  of  bhakti-yoga,  only  in  as  much  as  it  proves  to demonstrate that unless one can show the universal form, one should not be accepted as God.

The  åcårya  Baladeva  Vidyåbhüßa√a  con- firms this (prasåde vismaye harße dvi-trîr-uktaμ na dußyati) as  does  the  famous  commentator  on  Bhagavad-gîtå A.C. Bhaktivedånta  Svåmî  Prabhupåda,  who  writes  in  his  pur- port to verse nineteen as follows: There is no limit to the extent of the six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here and in Chapter 11 279 many other places there is repetition, but according to the scriptures, repetition of the glories of K®ß√a is not a literary weakness. It is said that at a time of bewilderment or wonder or of great ecstasy, statements are repeated over and over. That is not a flaw.

This is described in the following verses: sat-pu√∂arîka-nayanaμ meghåbhaμ vaidyutåmbaram dvi-bhujaμ jñåna-mudrå∂hyaμ vana-målinam îçvaram I meditate on Çrî K®ß√a, whose beautiful eyes are like lotuses, whose hue is that of a new rain cloud, whose clothes are as bright as lightning, who possesses two arms, who is adorned by a beautiful forest garland, and whose hand shows the jñåna-mudrå indicating divine knowledge.

Now Arjuna asks for spe- cial clarification as to which is the better path – the path of bhakti-yoga centred on K®ß√a directly and performed with acts of devotion, or the impersonal path that tries to focus on K®ß√a’s Brahman effulgence (brahma-jyoti). 304 Bhagavad-gita This  is  a  question  for  many  persons  starting  on  the","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"9016e5ce-7e28-4344-95a6-a676ce19caaf":{"id_":"9016e5ce-7e28-4344-95a6-a676ce19caaf","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"99d482cd-a7ff-4529-8ae8-3481463bf1c2","metadata":{},"hash":"sZuC8eM+xdwXErMvWM2aDXuAntrWYaHu89LaY5ezOk8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5e0a91c5-5711-43a8-b054-c9b7a15e9acd","metadata":{},"hash":"ISM3Iu8pSntN8kzEEDiFYhtNv2XFFYNxY6TGM2vWXvs="}},"hash":"w29vXc9POG2UDFqo7Iim360UNq9mVKLvLuKLOLjVT2Q=","text":"This  is  a  question  for  many  persons  starting  on  the path of transcendence – which path is better, the personal or the impersonal? Here, Çrî K®ß√a says that the personal path is best. The bhakti-yogî, who is fixed in meditation on K®ß√a’s form of beauty, who constantly glorifies Him with great faith and determination is the best of yogîs. The bhakti-yogîs  that  engage  on  the  personal  path  of self-realisation are called Vaiß√avas. Those on the imper- sonal path are of three types – Brahmavådîs (Vedåntists), Çünyavådîs    (Buddhists)    and    Måyåvådîs    (Ça∫karites). Brahmavådîs  are  those  who  seek  to  merge  the  self  (åtmå) into  the  bodily  effulgence  of  K®ß√a. Çünyavådîs  seek  to annihilate  everything  and  enter  the  void  (çünya)  and  the Måyåvådîs seek to become God themselves. The  Brahmavådîs  seek  to  merge  with  the  Brahman effulgence,  but  they  have  little  or  no  knowledge  of  the personal form of K®ß√a. Thus they only reach K®ß√a after many lifetimes as will be explained in verse 4. In the annals of  self-realisation,  there  are  many  instances  of yogîs  and Brahmavådîs  failing  to  achieve  Brahman  realisation  and even accounts of those such as the Four Kumåras, Vasiß†ha Muni, Çukadeva Gosvåmî and others, who after achieving Brahman  realisation,  abandoned  that  for  the  higher  bliss of bhakti-yoga.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"5e0a91c5-5711-43a8-b054-c9b7a15e9acd":{"id_":"5e0a91c5-5711-43a8-b054-c9b7a15e9acd","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9016e5ce-7e28-4344-95a6-a676ce19caaf","metadata":{},"hash":"w29vXc9POG2UDFqo7Iim360UNq9mVKLvLuKLOLjVT2Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2a6d10c1-f7b8-44c3-9fb2-a910de20a65b","metadata":{},"hash":"Plg4GR80ohQlHs28K9cHXuZ+YPNU28SOEKktj4Y8OKU="}},"hash":"ISM3Iu8pSntN8kzEEDiFYhtNv2XFFYNxY6TGM2vWXvs=","text":"of bhakti-yoga.

The Måyåvådîs reject the personal form of K®ß√a as a  manifestation  of måyå  (illusion)  and  want  to  become God themselves. Måyåvådîs are considered offenders and return to the world of birth and death. Chapter 12 305 Throughout  the Bhagavad-gîtå,  K®ß√a’s  statements  are consistent in that He repeatedly confirms that of all paths, bhakti-yoga  is  the  best. Among  all  types  of yogîs, jñånîs, philosophers  and  philanthropists,  the bhakti-yogî  who  is fully absorbed in K®ß√a without any material desires or the desire for liberation, is the best and is very dear to Him. anyåbhilåßitå-çünyaμ jñåna-karmådy-anåv®tam ånukülyena k®ß√ånu-çîlanaμ bhaktir-uttamå In the highest plane of bhakti-yoga one is devoid of all material desires, material activities and the desire for  liberation.

But how are people to develop them? Independently these qualities, and other desirable qual- ities  of  the  human  being  mentioned  throughout Bhaga- vad-gîtå are difficult to develop. It is seen that sometimes a person may possess one, two or three of such qualities, but where is that person who has all these qualities? K®ß√a  gives  the  answer  in Bhagavad-gîtå  –  become  a bhakti-yogî, take shelter of K®ß√a and surrender everything to  Him. The åtmå  is  naturally  complete  with  all  good qualities as could ever be desired by a human being. When one’s  mind,  intelligence,  and  consciousness  are  purified by  being  in  association  with  K®ß√a  through  the  process of bhakti-yoga, all desirable qualities develop. Therefore, the open secret to life is that everyone should become a yogî in bhakti-yoga. Then the world would become a much better place. Above  all  good  qualities  is  the  quality  of  devotion  to the  Supreme  Person,  from  which  all  other  good  qualities manifest in great abundance. One does not become dear to K®ß√a simply by independently developing good qualities. All  such  qualities  must  be  dovetailed  with  the  quality  of devotion. One  who  approaches  life  in  that  way  is  a  true bhakti-yogî and is very dear to K®ß√a. 316 Bhagavad-gita","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"1ee5fd78-feab-4dec-8ef2-227e21ee62b6":{"id_":"1ee5fd78-feab-4dec-8ef2-227e21ee62b6","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b6d0df64-89fb-479c-9530-69d51150229f","metadata":{},"hash":"ocNe2YYI3qLOjTBbnAoB3cTJ9vjv5GqO+XTHUdpO6XE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5d10e4bb-e1c8-4d43-a4e1-de7b36e04e1c","metadata":{},"hash":"053oy2G4f1jQm7QCS4BcPo351hFRdESzRWvL7btRULY="}},"hash":"EG2HOtMQZ5ev1QdIFiKJ1bdq+3QJ3jPK0lxip8mFkdQ=","text":"316 Bhagavad-gita ॐ तिदित ीमहाभारते शतसाहां संिहतायां वैयािसां भीपवािण ीमगवीतासूपिनष िवायां योगशाे ीकाजनसंवादे भियोगो नाम ादशोऽायः॥ oμ tat saditi çrî-mahåbhårate-çata-såhasryåμ saμhitåyåμ vaiyåsikyåμ bhîßma-parvå√i çrîmad bhagavad-gîtåsüpanißatsu brahma-vidyåyåμ yoga-çåstre çrî k®ß√årjuna-saμvåde bhakti-yogo nåma dvådaço’dhyåya ̇ OÂ  TAT  SAT  –  Thus  ends  Chapter  Twelve  entitled Bhakti Yoga from the conversation between Çrî K®ß√a and Arjuna  in  the  Upanißad  known  as  Çrîmad  Bhagavad-gîtå, the yoga-çåstra  of  divine  knowledge,  from  the  Bhîßma- parva of Mahåbhårata, the literature revealed by Vyåsa in one hundred thousand verses.

Both are distinct from one another and one who understands this is truly learned.

All contemporary fields of knowledge i.e. biology, physics, math- ematics  and  philosophy  lead  one  to  accept  the  body  as  the self  and  to  accept  gratification  of  one’s  mind,  intelligence, ego  and  senses  as  the  goal  of  life. Such  an  understanding  is utterly devoid of the real purpose of life, considering that this one life is the all in all and that after death there is nothing. The material world is a place of birth, death, old age and disease and is sometimes referred to as m®tyu-loka or the planet of death. Birth, death, old age and disease are indeed the real problems facing all living beings regardless of race, nationality or belief. Any knowledge that does not aim to put an end to these miseries is certainly incomplete at best. There are, of course, medicines, drugs, surgery and medical machines to ease the pain of birth, slow the old age process, cure some diseases and prolong the process of dying, but these are only stopgaps or temporary solutions. One  should  recognise  these  problems  of  life  and  be inquisitive as to where the real solution is to be found. 324 Bhagavad-gita Contrary to modern scientific and philosophical under- standing, the Bhagavad-gîtå says that this one life is not the all in all, and that there is life after death. There was life before coming to this material world and that life contin- ues  eternally. All  that  really  changes  is  the  type  of  body one has. For the pious there is future life in higher plan- ets  enjoying  celestial  pleasures,  for  the  ignorant  there  are future sojourns within the bodies of lower species such as animals or plants, and for the yogî and for those who culti- vate knowledge of consciousness and Super Consciousness, there  is  future  existence  beyond  the  material  universes  in the Vaiku√†ha planets.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"f6d01626-a069-4c52-8531-943fde62c9c2":{"id_":"f6d01626-a069-4c52-8531-943fde62c9c2","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dd061210-ca7e-42a0-97d1-ef6a3196e82f","metadata":{},"hash":"FD1NWOJjozEZ86t1/31mBsUaoo82JQt07NYI63yIS3k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"55b54c73-c989-41b4-a092-63aba71537a2","metadata":{},"hash":"BZJ2yFbUL/WISnXvehzSKLXN/CrmxHLJJNBD2vQHG/M="}},"hash":"Cb3SMswlPhOAhWIYlM6tRoOM6j+e+aA9u50hyiN0c/8=","text":"the Vaiku√†ha planets.

The  ‘He’  of  whom  K®ß√a  speaks  of  in  these verses as being subordinate to Him, yet being the Supreme Brahman refers to the Paramåtmå. His hands, feet, eyes and ears are everywhere and He is situated in the hearts of all living beings. He is all-pervasive throughout the universe, Chapter 13 327 He divides Himself to be within all things, yet He Himself is not divided or diminished – He remains the Complete Person.

It may even be that sometimes the atheist is more correct in his opinion than the so-called theist. The theist establishes his God, and the atheist, upon examining the statements of the so-called theist, discovers that  the  God  in  question  is  wrathful,  vindictive,  jealous, vengeful,  sadomasochistic  etc. In  this  instance  we  would have to agree with the atheist – there is no such God. However, the atheist then concludes that in the absence of God, the universe and all life within it has come from nothing – yet he has no experience or proof that something can arise from nothing. His proposal is thus self-defeating. 328 Bhagavad-gita Both ‘God’ and His non-existence are but misconcep- tions in the minds of the so-called theist and the atheist. However, the student of Bhagavad-gîtå knows that the sub- ject matter is not a thesis about ‘God’. Bhagavad-gîtå is a discourse  aimed  at  enlightenment  in  the  Absolute  Truth.  The Absolute Truth contains all things known, knowable and  unknown  –  before  the  universe,  within  the  universe, after the universe and beyond the universe.

Material nature is described as the body, senses and other elements as well as the transformations of qualities such as happiness, distress, lamentation and illusion. The living  beings  are  part  and  parcel  of  the  Supreme  Person.  They are sac-cid-ånanda – having the constitution of eter- nity, knowledge and bliss. When the living beings identify the self as the material body, they suffer under the miser- ies of happiness and distress and perpetually transmigrate from one body to the next in the cycle of birth and death. One  of  the  greatest  questions  in  life,  namely,  “Where do we come from?” is certainly answered in Bhagavad-gîtå.

Çrîdhara Mahåråja says as follows: 332 Bhagavad-gita Since  time  immemorial,  man  has  inquired  about  the origin of the living being. Who am I? Where have I come from? How does the living being first appear in this world? From what stage of spiritual existence does he fall into the material world? There  are  two  classes  of  living  beings  who  come into this world. One class comes from the spiritual Vaiku√†ha  planets  by  the  necessity  of  nitya-lîlå, the  eternal  pastimes  of  K®ß√a. Another  comes  by constitutional necessity. The brahma-jyoti,  the  non- differentiated marginal plane, is the source of infinite living beings (jîvåtmås), atomic spiritual particles of non-differentiated character. The  rays  of  the  transcendental  body  of  the  Supreme Person are known as the brahma-jyoti,  and  a  ray of  the  brahma-jyoti is  the  jîvåtmå. The jîvåtmå  is an atom in that effulgence, and the brahma-jyoti  is a  product  of  an  infinite  number  of  jîvåtmå atoms. Generally, jîvåtmås emanate from the brahma-jyoti which is living and growing. Within the brahma-jyoti, their equilibrium is somehow disturbed and movement begins. From  non-differentiation,  differentiation begins. From a plain sheet of uniform consciousness, individual  conscious  units  grow.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"18fc0aca-ab29-4d49-b381-306e24027471":{"id_":"18fc0aca-ab29-4d49-b381-306e24027471","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"bd2d9283-1d73-43c2-ba68-5a8a416d42f6","metadata":{},"hash":"rr4waEvyrkjxsnK6zuMQrs1l/cSw1ytRzyu3qhBZfqU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"217ceb73-6bdb-4c15-8b8b-b3b4ddd2ed56","metadata":{},"hash":"QXMb/ek37tsk99p4jEwW5mjBD7onHIdcOz44+iF8NJ4="}},"hash":"pWXwQnhPxtvqV6vG4nOj6v8+0y1s0kJScUTklVwdHKQ=","text":"From a plain sheet of uniform consciousness, individual  conscious  units  grow.

When the jîvåtmå, by exercise of his free will and out of curiosity, first enters into this land – from then he becomes a factor of this limited world. But his partic- ipation is beyond the beginning of this limited world. That is why it is said to be anådi. Anådi means that it does not come from within the jurisdiction of this limited world. Once subject to contact with material nature, the living beings  are  then  subject  to  karma,  the  laws  of  action  and reaction. Under these laws the living beings enjoy and suffer in  various  species  of  life. During  their  material  sojourn, the  Paramåtmå  accompanies  the  living  beings  and  is  ever watchful  for  when  they  will  turn  their  head  towards  the Absolute Truth.

The knowledge  attained  through  the  study  of  Bhagavad-gîtå enables one to transcend the modes of nature because such knowledge  is  in  itself  transcendental  and  free  from  the defects of mistakes (bhrama), illusion (pramåda), cheating (vipralipså)  and  false  perception  (kara√åpå†ava). In  other words, the knowledge contained in Bhagavad-gîtå is perfect and  complete. By  transcending  the  modes  of  nature,  Çrî K®ß√a promises that one will be liberated from the miseries of birth, death, old age and disease and one will taste the nectar  of  immortality. This  is  also  confirmed  in  the ˆço- panißad as follows: vidyåμ cåvidyåμ ca yas tad vedobhayaμ saha avidyayå m®tyuμ tîrtvå vidyayåm®tam açnute One who transcends ignorance (avidyå) and attains transcendental  knowledge  certainly  rises  above  the influence of repeated birth and death and tastes the nectar of immortality.

Accordingly,  no  scientific  knowledge  is  perfect,  nor  can it  be  perfect. Truly,  by  the  admission  of  many  scientists, they  never  really  attain  the  end  of  knowledge. The  more they  learn,  the  more  there  is  to  learn,  or  the  more  they learn, the more they discover that their predecessors were wrong. In any case, scientists admit that they do not have perfect knowledge – death comes and another generation of scientists is reduced to dust. Knowledge  that  is  descending  from  Çrî  K®ß√a  and through the guru-disciple paramparå is known as avaroha- panthå  and  is  free  from  material  defects. Bhagavad-gîtå means the words of Çrî K®ß√a – hearing which enables one to achieve the perfection of life before death comes.

The word ‘fallible’ comes from the Latin word fallere that means ‘to deceive’. In order to deceive there must be ignorance, forgetfulness and suspicion etc. However, considering that no material qualities exist in the Supreme Abode, it is not possible for any  liberated  living  being  there  to  become  contaminated by material qualities.

K®ß√a does not say that going again to that Supreme Abode one  never  returns. Therefore,  it  is  understood  by  K®ß√a’s own words that no one falls from the Supreme Abode.

We are led to believe that there is no ultimate reality, that this one life is the all in all, and therefore we should enjoy it while it lasts – the fulfilment of the sexual lust of men and women being at the forefront of such enjoyment. The epitome of this is represented worldwide by the casual and legal acceptance of contraception and abortion. With the present mentality of the human being, it seems that the world is set on a path of destruction – with dev- astation of the environment, economic collapse, extinction of  species  and  even  genocide  of  certain  races  of  humans. Have we no eyes to see what is happening? Has the human race  become  so  proud  and  arrogant  of  it’s  achievements that it has become blind? Good government is essential in a civilised world.

Amassing  wealth  by  any  means  and  depriving  the  people from  even  the  most  basic  necessities  of  life,  such  despots know no shame. Indeed, the world is in a period of great darkness at the hands of the asura mentality. From their high pulpits the heads of state declare, “Our enemies  must  be  killed. The  evildoers  must  be  defeated. We  shall  be  victorious,  we  shall  rule  the  world,  we  shall enjoy,  we  are  the  chosen  people,  we  are  powerful,  we  are happy and none are our equals!” And while the hysteria of the masses runs wild, the innocent are sent to their graves and the Earth weeps for her children. Yet it seems we are unfazed. Such, K®ß√a says, is our ignorance.

These  are  indeed  the  cause  of great  misfortune  amongst  all  living  beings  and  such  are the destroyers of self-realisation. Therefore, lust, anger and greed must be conquered by one who wants to make pro- gress in human life.

Çrî  K®ß√a  then  further  describes  food,  sacrifice,  austerity and charity as they are influenced by, or born of, the three modes of material nature. First faith (çraddhå) is discussed. Çrî K®ß√a tells Arjuna that çraddhå arises in this life due to one’s own nature and from  impressions  in  the  mind  from  previous  lives. All activities in life depend on faith to one degree or another. It  does  not  matter  what  one’s  creed  may  be  –  theist  or atheist, one must have faith. The theist has faith that there is a God, and the atheist has faith that there is no God. If one states a particular doctrine or philosophy, but says he has no ‘faith’ then that is pure hypocrisy. K®ß√a  says  that  when  one’s  faith  is  in  the  mode  of goodness,  one  worships  the  demigods  such  as  Ga√eça, Çiva, Sürya, Indra and Sarasvatî etc. When one’s faith is in the mode of passion, one worships the spirits in nature or the  ancestors  –  this  also  includes  humanists  and  atheists. When one’s faith is in the mode of ignorance, one is found to  worship  ghosts  and  spirits. All  these  types  of  worship are current in the world today. In India, many people worship the demigods by building big temples and offering fire sacrifices known as yajñas. In 394 Bhagavad-gita the Far East, ancestor worship is very popular amongst the Buddhists, Shintoists and Taoists. Similarly, in Europe and America, great monuments are erected to revere scientists, politicians, soldiers, movie stars, rock stars etc. In Africa, Tibet, Mexico and South America, the worship of ghosts and spirits is popular.

To   be  transcendental   to   material   nature   means  to accept  the  Vedas  and  thus  be  situated  beyond  the  modes of  nature  in  the  realm  of viçuddha-sattva,  pure  goodness. When  one’s  faith  is  situated  in  pure  goodness,  one  wor- ships the Supreme Person, K®ß√a. This is the highest stage of  monotheism  –  the  acceptance  of  one  Supreme  Being. Pure-goodness is described by Çiva as follows: sattvaμ viçuddhaμ vasudeva-çabditaμ yad îyate tatra pumån apåv®ta ̇ sattve ca tasmin bhagavån våsudevo hy adhokßajo me namaså vidhîyate One should always worship K®ß√a in pure goodness.

Food  that  increases  life,  gives  energy,  strength,  health, happiness  and  satisfaction  is  in  the  mode  of  goodness. This  includes  fruits,  vegetables,  grains,  sugar,  salt,  spices and milk products. These are basically known as vegetarian foods and are dear to those in the mode of goodness. Food  that  is  too  bitter,  too  sour,  too  sweet,  too  salty, too spicy, too pungent and too dry, that creates excessive heat in the stomach, causes pain, creates gas and disease is to  be  known  as  food  in  the  mode  of  passion.

These  austerities  are  described  in  verses  14,  15  and  16. Physical  austerities  are  described  as  maintaining  purity (cleanliness), sincerity, celibacy and non-violence. Celibacy means  not  to  engage  in  acts  of  illicit  sex  (sex  outside  of marriage). Physical  austerity  also  includes  the  worship  of the  Supreme  Person  and  honouring  the  guru  and  saintly persons. Austerities that are performed out of pride and for the purpose of prestige, name and fame are to be rejected. This may  also  include  fasting  for  political,  social  or  economic advantages. Austerities  performed  out  of  foolishness  that cause pain and suffering should also be rejected.

But  our  present  reality  is  quite  different  –  there are shortages of food, inadequate clothing, shelter, educa- tion  and  medical  treatment  in  many  places  in  the  world, causing  millions  of  human  beings  to  suffer  unnecessarily.

They  have  amassed so much that no individual could spend or use that much wealth  within  one  or  even  a  dozen  lifetimes. Corporate giants  receive  millions  of  dollars  in  annual  bonuses  while millions  of  children  die  each  year  due  to  malnutrition. Is this not shameful? Charity,  like  other  things  discussed  in  this  chapter,  is also in the different modes of nature according to how it is given and whom it is given to. There is charity in goodness, passion  and  ignorance  as  stated  by  Çrî  K®ß√a  above,  but ultimately  the  highest  charity  is  to  give  that  which  helps the human being bring an end to all material miseries and even to death itself. Such charity is the distribution of the spiritual wealth found in Bhagavad-gîtå. The root cause of all suffering in the world is a lack of understanding  of  who  we  are,  where  we  have  come  from, what  the  purpose  of  life  is  and  where  we  will  go  at  the time of death. One who understands these things from the perspective  of Bhagavad-gîtå  becomes  full  in  knowledge, free from the illusion of the body as the self and ultimately defeats death.

G®hasthas are  the  householders,  whose  duties  are  to  earn  an  honest living, to give in charity and to raise children.

Seeing  friends  and  well-wishers  on  both  sides, Arjuna initially resolved not to fight, but to throw down his weapons and renounce his duty. Çrî K®ß√a herein brings our attention back to the battlefield when He says, hatvå’pi sa  imål-lokån  na  hanti  na  nibadhyate  –  he  who  kills  does not actually kill and does not incur any reaction. If Arjuna abandons his duty as a warrior, then certainly he will incur a karmic reaction for avoiding his duty. How- ever,  Arjuna  will  not  actually  ‘kill’  anyone  in  the  truest sense of the word, because the living beings arrayed before him  ready  for  battle  are  eternal  parts  and  parcels  of  the Supreme Person and thus eternal. The åtmå can never be ‘killed’.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"f8baf00a-b82f-4885-93f7-1d7d27d5c34e":{"id_":"f8baf00a-b82f-4885-93f7-1d7d27d5c34e","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1339ddbd-8ad6-4084-81b8-f3d11ef1389d","metadata":{},"hash":"beVSYWERKLG55YNjpj0EQtKgkqysZP3nB7NFWoPv3l0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"984dbf10-5da3-40a6-9a13-f5f72a8a6da3","metadata":{},"hash":"d2EbgKrqEZeVUseWwS+262+5LM73DmuwdiD1D96zRdw="}},"hash":"04QjPTexEmZkSLR7LsshYGQXZurK/KAoWaNY+6q7FSQ=","text":"Supreme Person and thus eternal.

There are no elephant, tiger or animal åtmås as distinguished from human åtmås. One who says that the åtmå of an animal and that of a human or a demigod are different åtmås has knowledge influenced by the mode of passion. One  who  has  no  proper  understanding  of  the  åtmå, who is attached to the body, the actions of the body, who is absorbed in the trivial pursuits of economic develop- ment and sense enjoyment, is said to have knowledge in the mode of ignorance.

Anuv®tti Throughout  the  Bhagavad-gîtå,  Çrî  K®ß√a  addresses Arjuna  as  Pårtha,  the  son  of  Kuntî. K®ß√a  also  addresses him  as  Bhårata  (best  of  the  Bharata  Dynasty),  På√∂ava (son of På√∂u), Kuru-nandana (descendant of the Kurus), Parantapa  (conqueror  of  the  enemy),  Gu∂åkeça  (con- queror  of  sleep)  and  Dhanañjaya,  (winner  of  wealth).  K®ß√a addresses Arjuna thusly to remind him of his posi- tion  as  a  great  warrior  in  a  dynasty  of  warriors  and  to encourage him to stand and fight. Sometimes  fighting  is  necessary  if  it  is  for  the  right cause,  but  the  problem  lies  herein. Who  is  to  say  which cause is just, who is right and who is wrong, what should be done and what should not be done? In the above verses, K®ß√a gives some indication as to who is of the right men- tality and right determination. Clearly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance are always mistaken – not being able to distinguish right from wrong, what is to be done from what is not to be done, or proper duty from derelic- tion of duty.

These Chapter 18 433 are the natural divisions in society and they are determined by the quality of their work. Unfortunately,  in  modern  India,  this  social  system described  by  Çrî  K®ß√a  in  the Bhagavad-gîtå  has  become corrupted  and  is  now  known  as  the  caste  system  which determines  one’s  social  status  by  birth. The  caste  system is not actually the social system described in Bhagavad-gîtå known as var√åçrama-dharma. The caste system in India is certainly deplorable, hardly better  than  that  of  slavery,  because  it  limits  a  person’s potential according to one’s birth. K®ß√a clearly states that a person is to be known by his actions and not his pedigree. Although  social  systems  having  intellectuals,  adminis- trators, mercantile and labour classes are found around the world, they are also not the same as the var√åçrama system mentioned in Bhagavad-gîtå. In  addition  to  being  an  intellectual,  a  bråhma√a must know what is Brahman. A kßatriya must do more than just administrate and fight battles – he must be above corrup- tion,  give  protection  to  the  people  and  protect  the  prin- ciples of dharma found in Bhagavad-gîtå. And above all, a kßatriya is never to be an aggressor – he is never to invade a sovereign country.

Naturally,  the  purpose  of  busi- ness  is  to  earn  a  living,  but  nowadays  this  has  gone  far beyond actual necessity as per the advice of Bhagavad-gîtå. Simple  business  has  turned  into  massive  industry  –  the establishing  of  mega  multi-national  corporations,  money hoarding and fractional banking. These in turn have led to the corruption of government officials around the world 434 Bhagavad-gita and  ultimately  to  the  destruction  of  the  environment, increased poverty, and war. Cow protection (k®ßi-gorakßya) is especially mentioned in verse 44 because of all animals it is the cow that is most necessary  for  the  survival  of  the  human  being. Human bodies thrive on animal fat and the cow is the animal that provides human beings with the most milk, yogurt, butter, cheese etc. Milk and milk products, when taken in appro- priate quantities, provide the human being all the necessary fat  required  for  healthy  living,  thus  enabling  the  suspen- sion  of  animal  slaughter. In  other  words,  killing  animals and eating meat is not necessary to obtain fat. When cows are protected then there will be plenty of whole milk avail- able for everyone to maintain a healthy diet. The value of the  cow  for  human  society  is  indisputable  and  therefore in  Vedic  culture  the  cow  is  considered  one  of  the  seven natural mothers.

In  actuality,  the  people  have  lost  their  lands and the family farm that was once the backbone of socie- ties everywhere has ceased to exist.

Arjuna was disinclined to fight and was thinking that it might be better to take up the plough or the staff of renunciation, but K®ß√a did not agree. Now  the  dialogue  between  Çrî  K®ß√a  and  Arjuna  is drawing  to  a  close  and  we  will  soon  see  that  K®ß√a  has revived  Arjuna  and  with  a  regained  heart,  he  will  resume his duty with full enthusiasm.

This superior realm is also known as Goloka V®ndåvana and is described in Brahma-saμhitå as follows: cintåma√i-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-v®kßa- lakßåv®teßu surabhîr abhipålayantam lakßmî-sahasra-çata-sambhrama-sevyamånaμ govindam ådi-purußaμ tam ahaμ bhajåmi I worship Govinda, the Original Person, who is tend-","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"552e6363-d84d-4df9-86f7-2fd158b40d20":{"id_":"552e6363-d84d-4df9-86f7-2fd158b40d20","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/gita_asis.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"p5prC4WcPXsNzJO5Os5hSB9kGhwilj7nBqkjGiVgbAM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"667f5982-9f6b-4f62-99f7-be0bf7237778","metadata":{},"hash":"Y4DK+CxhjIvXSaNl+b8J/dRktS+DM/9Y0wyGay4EsAE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"edf82447-930a-4925-9622-5c6ff9c1ea1a","metadata":{},"hash":"ARylpr2ETsOAv3vNrKmlQVK0yM7DokgSLas9/jZgMEg="}},"hash":"Pf/ZpISXEiq+QkHr/yRaePHCqqlJCwUR3Z/C8RYQEVs=","text":"I worship Govinda, the Original Person, who is tend- ing the cows, in that divine realm where the abodes are built with touchstone.
